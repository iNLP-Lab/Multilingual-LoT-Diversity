Additionally, 7 is not typically associated with common password patterns (e.g., 1234567890) and is statistically less frequent in brute-force attempts. Always ensure the rest of the password is randomly generated and includes a mix of characters for maximum security. \n\n**Answer**: 7"], "partition": [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6], "distinct": 6, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.7284812927246094], [[0, 2], 0.7730295062065125], [[0, 3], 0.06504836678504944], [[0, 4], 0.07637494802474976], [[0, 5], 0.0630132406949997], [[0, 6], 0.07009116560220718], [[0, 7], 0.19280797243118286], [[0, 8], 0.06348363310098648], [[0, 9], 0.08030593395233154], [[0, 10], 0.5195797681808472], [[0, 11], 0.0683150440454483], [[0, 12], 0.10308154672384262], [[0, 13], 0.08793852478265762], [[0, 14], 0.06703051924705505], [[0, 15], 0.24088062345981598], [[0, 16], 0.21573805809020996], [[0, 17], 0.5996847152709961], [[0, 18], 0.06499546021223068], [[0, 19], 0.06655451655387878], [[3, 4], 0.05836373567581177], [[3, 5], 0.062028538435697556], [[3, 6], 0.058732133358716965], [[3, 8], 0.05859887972474098], [[3, 9], 0.06019068509340286], [[3, 11], 0.05862141028046608], [[3, 13], 0.05999172851443291], [[3, 14], 0.0772944763302803], [[3, 18], 0.12197340279817581], [[3, 19], 0.08873730152845383], [[4, 5], 0.05919516086578369], [[4, 6], 0.05966217443346977], [[4, 8], 0.06402473896741867], [[4, 9], 0.05961232632398605], [[4, 11], 0.08317455649375916], [[4, 13], 0.8105780482292175], [[4, 14], 0.058316670358181], [[4, 19], 0.06022883206605911], [[5, 6], 0.05889613926410675], [[5, 8], 0.06356513500213623], [[5, 9], 0.07131431251764297], [[5, 11], 0.06243313476443291], [[5, 14], 0.8311616778373718], [[5, 19], 0.06817185878753662], [[6, 8], 0.059058692306280136], [[6, 9], 0.06820923089981079], [[6, 11], 0.060857124626636505], [[6, 19], 0.058606088161468506], [[8, 9], 0.5173612833023071], [[8, 11], 0.1022835224866867], [[8, 19], 0.06232157722115517]]}

Now, they exist as a shifting, shadowy entity with eyes like molten gold, bound to protect the world from intruders.

Over centuries, it became twisted by the darkness of the underworld, its form a fusion of flickering shadows and faint, golden light. It now roams the tunnels, drawn to the fear and desperation of lost children, believing their tears can reignite the surface\u2019s light. The wraith\u2019s true purpose is to protect the balance between worlds, but its corrupted nature causes it to attack intruders, mistaking them for the \"lightless\" beings that once destroyed its kind.

When the child fell into the world, the Warden awoke, mistaking the child\u2019s presence for an omen of the surface\u2019s encroachment.

{"idx": 40, "question": "Which university graduate program in the world is the hardest to get into?", "responses": ["The question of which graduate program is the hardest to get into is subjective and depends on various factors, including the field of study, university reputation, and individual circumstances. However, some programs are widely regarded as extremely competitive due to their prestige, limited spots, and high standards. Here are some notable examples:\n\n1. **Harvard Law School (USA)**: Known for its rigorous admissions process, Harvard Law School consistently ranks among the most selective law schools globally. It often has an acceptance rate below 10%, with applicants typically having exceptional academic records, high LSAT scores, and significant extracurricular involvement.\n\n2. **Stanford Graduate School of Business (USA)**: Stanford's MBA program is one of the most competitive in the world, with a highly selective admissions process that emphasizes leadership potential, academic excellence, and professional experience.\n\n3. **Oxford and Cambridge University (UK)**: These institutions are renowned for their rigorous entrance exams (e.g., the Oxford TSA or Cambridge interviews) and competitive graduate programs in fields like philosophy, economics, and sciences. Their programs often require exceptional academic performance and strong recommendation letters.\n\n4. **MIT (USA)**: MIT's graduate programs, particularly in engineering, computer science, and physics, are highly selective. Admission often depends on groundbreaking research potential, academic achievements, and strong letters of recommendation.\n\n5. **Medical Schools (e.g., Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins)**: Medical graduate programs are extremely competitive, requiring high MCAT scores, strong academic records, and extensive clinical experience.\n\n6. **PhD Programs in Highly Competitive Fields**: Programs in fields like theoretical physics, mathematics, or computer science at top institutions (e.g., Princeton, Caltech, or ETH Zurich) are notoriously difficult due to limited funding, high research standards, and intense competition.\n\n**Key Considerations**:  \n- **Field-Specific Challenges**: Programs in medicine, law, and certain STEM fields are inherently more competitive.  \n- **Geographic and Cultural Factors**: Programs in countries with high academic standards (e.g., the UK, Germany, or Japan) may have unique challenges.  \n- **Personal Circumstances**: Applicants with unique backgrounds, gaps in education, or non-traditional paths may face additional hurdles.  \n\nIn conclusion, while no single program can be universally labeled as \"the hardest,\" Harvard Law School, Stanford Business School, and top-tier PhD programs in STEM or humanities are often cited as among the most selective globally. The difficulty also depends on the applicant's field, location, and individual qualifications.", "The hardest graduate program to get into is often considered to be the PhD programs at top-tier universities like Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, and Cambridge. These programs are highly competitive due to limited spots, rigorous academic requirements, and intense research expectations. Fields like medicine, computer science, and physics are particularly challenging. However, the \"hardest\" can vary by discipline and region, with some specialized programs having extremely low acceptance rates.", "The hardest graduate program to get into globally is often considered to be the **MD-PhD program** at the **Harvard Medical School** or similar combined medical and research programs at institutions like **Johns Hopkins University** or **Stanford University**. These programs are extremely competitive due to their dual focus on clinical medicine and research, requiring exceptional academic performance, high scores on standardized tests (e.g., MCAT, GRE), and a strong research background.  \n\nOther highly selective programs include:  \n- **Graduate School of Business (MBA)** at **Harvard University** or **Stanford University** (extremely competitive for top-tier MBA programs).  \n- **PhD programs** in fields like **physics, mathematics, or computer science** at institutions like **MIT**, **Caltech**, or **Princeton University**, which often have acceptance rates below 5%.  \n- **Law School** programs (e.g., **Yale Law School** or **Harvard Law School**) for JD degrees, which are highly selective.  \n\nHowever, the \"hardest\" depends on the field and program. For example, **MD-PhD programs** are often cited as the most challenging due to their rigorous dual-degree requirements and limited spots.", "The hardest graduate program to get into is often considered to be the **Harvard Medical School** (MD program), though this is a professional doctoral program rather than a traditional graduate program. For graduate-level programs (e.g., Master's or PhDs), the **Yale Law School** (JD program) and the **Stanford Graduate School of Business** (MBA program) are frequently cited as highly competitive. However, the **University of Chicago's Graduate Division** (particularly in economics or physics) and the **MIT Sloan School of Management** (MBA) also have extremely low acceptance rates. \n\nFor PhD programs, the **University of Cambridge's Graduate School** (e.g., in natural sciences) and the **Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences** (e.g., in humanities or social sciences) are among the most selective.

{"idx": 43, "question": "Which dog breed is the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner?", "responses": ["The question of which dog breed is least suitable for a first-time dog owner depends on various factors, including the owner's lifestyle, experience, and the specific needs of the breed. However, certain breeds are generally considered more challenging for first-time owners due to their high energy levels, training requirements, or specific temperaments. For example:\n\n1. **Bernese Mountain Dog**: These large, gentle giants require significant space, time, and attention. Their size and potential for separation anxiety make them unsuitable for inexperienced owners.\n2. **Rottweiler**: While loyal and protective, they demand consistent training, socialization, and firm leadership. Their strength and potential for aggression if not properly trained can be overwhelming for novices.\n3. **Pit Bull Terrier**: Despite their friendly nature, they require structured training and socialization to prevent behavioral issues. Their high energy and need for mental stimulation can be demanding.\n4. **Border Collie**: These highly intelligent and energetic dogs need constant mental and physical activity. Without proper engagement, they may become destructive or bored.\n5. **Great Dane**: Their large size, sensitivity, and need for a calm environment make them challenging for first-time owners who may lack experience in managing such a big dog.\n\n**Key Considerations**:  \n- **Energy Levels**: Breeds with high energy (e.g., Border Collies) require daily exercise and mental stimulation.  \n- **Training Needs**: Breeds requiring advanced training (e.g., Rottweilers) need experienced handlers.  \n- **Temperament**: Breeds with strong protective instincts or potential for aggression (e.g., Pit Bulls) need careful handling.  \n- **Size and Space**: Large breeds (e.g., Great Danes) require ample living space and proper care.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While no breed is inherently \"bad\" for a first-time owner, breeds like the **Bernese Mountain Dog**, **Rottweiler**, or **Border Collie** are often cited as less suitable due to their specific needs. First-time owners should prioritize breeds with lower energy, easier training, and adaptability (e.g., Bulldogs, Beagles, or Cavalier King Charles Spaniels) and thoroughly research the breed's requirements before adoption. Always consider the owner's ability to meet the dog's physical, emotional, and financial needs.", "The question of which dog breed is least suitable for a first-time dog owner is complex, as individual temperament and training play significant roles.

Ultimately, responsible ownership and preparation are key, regardless of breed.", "The question is about identifying the dog breed least suited for a first-time dog owner. While there's no definitive answer, certain breeds are generally considered more challenging for beginners due to their specific needs. For example, **Bullmastiffs** or **Bergamasco Sheepdogs** (Bernese Mountain Dogs) may be less ideal for first-time owners because they require significant space, time, and experience. These breeds often have high energy levels, strong wills, or specific training needs that can overwhelm inexperienced handlers. \n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that individual temperament and training play a major role. A breed's suitability depends on the owner's lifestyle, ability to meet the dog's needs, and willingness to learn.

Always research and consider your lifestyle before choosing a breed.", "The dog breed that is least well-suited for a first-time dog owner is often considered to be the **Husky**. Here's why:\n\n1. **High Energy Levels**: Huskies are incredibly active and require substantial daily exercise and mental stimulation. Without sufficient physical activity, they can become destructive or develop behavioral issues.\n\n2. **Independent Nature**: Huskies are known for their strong-willed and independent personalities. They may not respond well to traditional training methods and can be stubborn, making them challenging for inexperienced owners.\n\n3. **Escapism**: Huskies are notorious escape artists. Their curiosity and desire to explore can lead them to run off if not properly secured, posing safety risks.\n\n4. **Social Needs**: They thrive on human interaction and can become anxious or bored if left alone for long periods, which is common for first-time owners who may not yet have the routine or experience to meet their needs.\n\nWhile other breeds like the **Doberman**, **Rottweiler**, or **German Shepherd** also require significant commitment, the **Husky** is frequently highlighted as particularly unsuitable for first-time owners due to its unique combination of energy, independence, and specific needs.

Always choose a dog that aligns with your ability to provide consistent care and attention."], "partition": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 4, 1, 3, 0, 4, 5, 2, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "distinct": 6, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.08011746406555176], [[0, 2], 0.12411989271640778], [[0, 3], 0.05295225605368614], [[0, 4], 0.23786090314388275], [[0, 5], 0.05598291754722595], [[0, 6], 0.055452216416597366], [[0, 7], 0.062355563044548035], [[0, 8], 0.060464341193437576], [[0, 9], 0.05766288936138153], [[0, 10], 0.1133773997426033], [[0, 11], 0.05626654252409935], [[0, 12], 0.05571730434894562], [[0, 13], 0.056622449308633804], [[0, 14], 0.05363020300865173], [[0, 15], 0.5435851216316223], [[0, 16], 0.0682566687464714], [[0, 17], 0.18888521194458008], [[0, 18], 0.1987084448337555], [[0, 19], 0.12136517465114594], [[1, 3], 0.053761448711156845], [[1, 5], 0.05839403718709946], [[1, 6], 0.05634421482682228], [[1, 7], 0.05935763195157051], [[1, 8], 0.3500451147556305], [[1, 9], 0.05780979245901108], [[1, 11], 0.056709542870521545], [[1, 12], 0.056960590183734894], [[1, 13], 0.06107001379132271], [[1, 14], 0.05432911217212677], [[1, 16], 0.28665295243263245], [[3, 5], 0.05709709972143173], [[3, 6], 0.05562157183885574], [[3, 7], 0.05460013821721077], [[3, 9], 0.0543537400662899], [[3, 11], 0.05623604357242584], [[3, 12], 0.05547010526061058], [[3, 13], 0.18292485177516937], [[3, 14], 0.053653571754693985], [[5, 6], 0.7121880054473877], [[5, 7], 0.05734829232096672], [[5, 9], 0.6425728797912598], [[5, 11], 0.05764598026871681], [[5, 12], 0.057752467691898346], [[5, 14], 0.05357862636446953], [[7, 11], 0.8545935153961182], [[7, 12], 0.06628923118114471], [[7, 14], 0.0766637772321701], [[12, 14], 0.055182576179504395]]}

It would turn everyday interactions into opportunities for growth, making life richer and more meaningful for all. \ud83c\udf0d\u2728"], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 7, 2, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 6, 2, 11], "distinct": 11, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.05157792940735817], [[0, 2], 0.05246726796030998], [[0, 3], 0.05347593128681183], [[0, 4], 0.07090926170349121], [[0, 5], 0.0910620391368866], [[0, 6], 0.05100888013839722], [[0, 7], 0.05324948579072952], [[0, 8], 0.05332131311297417], [[0, 9], 0.052877139300107956], [[0, 10], 0.05382606387138367], [[0, 11], 0.05145645886659622], [[0, 12], 0.051426250487565994], [[0, 13], 0.08639142662286758], [[0, 14], 0.05212174728512764], [[0, 15], 0.05079451575875282], [[0, 16], 0.05341986194252968], [[0, 17], 0.05105140432715416], [[0, 18], 0.054458264261484146], [[0, 19], 0.055038273334503174], [[1, 2], 0.05261673033237457], [[1, 3], 0.052106693387031555], [[1, 4], 0.053072117269039154], [[1, 5], 0.05252625420689583], [[1, 6], 0.05464012175798416], [[1, 7], 0.05280312895774841], [[1, 8], 0.05537202209234238], [[1, 9], 0.053052693605422974], [[1, 10], 0.07162262499332428], [[1, 11], 0.052078038454055786], [[1, 12], 0.0526040717959404], [[1, 13], 0.05454286187887192], [[1, 14], 0.05268750712275505], [[1, 15], 0.0535348542034626], [[1, 16], 0.054935257881879807], [[1, 17], 0.05318380147218704], [[1, 18], 0.05803457275032997], [[1, 19], 0.05324149504303932], [[2, 3], 0.8933488130569458], [[2, 4], 0.053372882306575775], [[2, 5], 0.05300333350896835], [[2, 6], 0.06241976469755173], [[2, 7], 0.05808890238404274], [[2, 8], 0.05335070937871933], [[2, 9], 0.9239134788513184], [[2, 10], 0.05869458243250847], [[2, 11], 0.12634135782718658], [[2, 12], 0.5898199081420898], [[2, 13], 0.05149955675005913], [[2, 14], 0.10041937232017517], [[2, 15], 0.05709170922636986], [[2, 16], 0.05633096769452095], [[2, 17], 0.05224636569619179], [[2, 18], 0.23379509150981903], [[2, 19], 0.053758639842271805], [[4, 5], 0.10706564784049988], [[4, 6], 0.05120179429650307], [[4, 7], 0.053819771856069565], [[4, 8], 0.053290944546461105], [[4, 10], 0.05546077340841293], [[4, 13], 0.10900384932756424], [[4, 14], 0.053761694580316544], [[4, 15], 0.05150393396615982], [[4, 16], 0.06900199502706528], [[4, 17], 0.05226822569966316], [[4, 19], 0.0550825260579586], [[6, 7], 0.05209909752011299], [[6, 8], 0.05633026361465454], [[6, 10], 0.07038917392492294], [[6, 14], 0.055877313017845154], [[6, 15], 0.05194992199540138], [[6, 16], 0.0509863905608654], [[6, 17], 0.08605378866195679], [[6, 19], 0.05114791542291641], [[7, 8], 0.07669223099946976], [[7, 10], 0.05554500222206116], [[7, 14], 0.05433061718940735], [[7, 15], 0.055656883865594864], [[7, 16], 0.057895272970199585], [[7, 17], 0.053332310169935226], [[7, 19], 0.05593571811914444], [[8, 10], 0.10075349360704422], [[8, 14], 0.056314561516046524], [[8, 15], 0.05235803499817848], [[8, 16], 0.053614068776369095], [[8, 17], 0.3359992802143097], [[8, 19], 0.056702278554439545], [[10, 14], 0.05407347157597542], [[10, 15], 0.05522747337818146], [[10, 16], 0.06297199428081512], [[10, 19], 0.05215131863951683], [[14, 15], 0.05386742949485779], [[14, 16], 0.054148752242326736], [[14, 19], 0.05479517579078674], [[15, 16], 0.0528818778693676], [[15, 19], 0.05172041431069374], [[16, 19], 0.05406981334090233]]}

Students might interpret it literally (counting chickens) instead of grasping its figurative meaning about not assuming future outcomes. It also highlights common grammar or idiomatic usage errors, which teachers often correct.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is \"It's\" instead of \"Its.\" This confusion between the contraction \"It's\" (for \"it is\" or \"it has\") and the possessive \"Its\" is a common grammar error that frustrates educators.", "**\"Actions speak louder than words.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it can be misused or overgeneralized. While it emphasizes the importance of deeds over empty promises, it can also be applied in ways that ignore context, such as excusing poor behavior with vague claims of \"intentions\" rather than accountability. Teachers may find it frustrating when students use it to deflect responsibility or avoid addressing real issues.", "A saying that English teachers might hate is **\"Practice makes perfect\"**, because it's often incomplete. The full version is **\"Perfect practice makes perfect\"**, and omitting the second part can lead to misunderstandings about the importance of quality practice over just repetition.", "**\"Don't leave me hanging.\"**  \n\nThis phrase is often used in casual contexts, but English teachers might dislike it because it can imply procrastination or lack of responsibility\u2014traits they typically want to discourage in students. \ud83d\ude0a", "**\"Practice makes perfect.\"**  \nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it's frequently misused or oversimplified. For example, students might incorrectly say \"Practice makes *perfecter*\" or assume it applies universally, ignoring cases where practice doesn't guarantee perfection. Teachers also appreciate its overuse and the nuances it overlooks.", "**\"Actions speak louder than words.\"**  \nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because students frequently misuse it. For example, they might say, \"He didn't *act* on his words,\" implying that actions are more important than words, but the phrase actually means that actions are more meaningful than empty talk. The confusion between \"act\" (to do something) and \"action\" (the result of an action) leads to frequent misinterpretation, which frustrates teachers.", "\"I before E except after C\" is a common saying that English teachers often dislike because it's an oversimplified and inaccurate rule for remembering the order of \"i\" and \"e\" in words. It fails to account for numerous exceptions, leading to confusion rather than clarity.", "\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nThis phrase is often misused or misremembered, with variations like \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" or even \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\" The repetition of \"do\" can confuse learners, making it a common target for English teachers to correct. The original saying emphasizes adapting to local customs, but the frequent errors in its phrasing make it a humorous example of a phrase that \"English teachers hate.\"", "**\"Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.\"**  \nThis saying is often misused by students who interpret it as \"keep everything, even if it's not useful,\" which frustrates English teachers who want students to understand its true meaning of preserving important things while discarding unnecessary ones.", "**\"Practice makes perfect.\"**  \nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because students may misuse it as an excuse for poor performance, implying that effort alone guarantees success, rather than acknowledging the need for quality practice and guidance.", "\"I'm not a native speaker.\"  \n\nThis phrase is often used by students to excuse mistakes in English, which can frustrate teachers who expect effort and practice rather than an excuse for errors.", "**\"Actions speak louder than words.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because students may misuse it to justify inaction or poor performance, implying that words alone are sufficient when they should be taking action. It can also be misinterpreted as a way to avoid accountability, which frustrates educators who value both verbal and practical responsibility.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I before E except after C\"**. While this rule is taught to help with spelling, it's frequently misapplied (e.g., in words like *jeopardy* or *flea*), leading to errors. Teachers may grow frustrated when students rigidly follow the rule without understanding its exceptions.", "**\"Actions speak louder than words.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often misused or misquoted, which is why English teachers might \"hate\" it. For example, some people incorrectly say *\"Actions speak louder than words\"* instead of the correct *\"Actions speak louder than words.\"* The extra \"than\" at the end is a common mistake, making it a favorite target for teachers to correct! \ud83d\ude0a", "**\"I could care less.\"**  \nThis phrase is often misused by students, as \"care less\" is grammatically incorrect. The correct expression is \"I couldn't care less,\" which means \"I don't care at all.\" English teachers typically dislike this error because it reflects a misunderstanding of the difference between \"could\" (possibility) and \"couldn't\" (negation).", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is \"There's a lot of people here.\" This is incorrect because \"people\" is a plural noun, so the correct phrase should be \"There are a lot of people here.\" The confusion between \"there's\" (contraction of \"there is\") and \"there are\" is a frequent grammar error.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I am sick and tired of this.\"** While it is grammatically correct, it's frequently overused and can come off as exaggerated or overly dramatic, which some teachers find unappealing in student writing. Alternatively, the phrase **\"I could have went\"** is a common grammar mistake (should be \"gone\") that frustrates educators. However, the most iconic answer to this joke is **\"I am sick and tired of this.\"**", "**\"Don't put all your eggs in one basket.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often misused or misunderstood, which might be why English teachers dislike it. Some people incorrectly apply it in contexts where it doesn't fit, or they confuse it with similar phrases like \"Don't put all your eggs in one basket\" (which is actually the correct version). The confusion or misuse can make it a target for teachers who emphasize accuracy.", "\"I don't care.\"  \n\nThis phrase is often used by students to express disinterest or defiance, which can frustrate English teachers who value engagement and effort in learning.
