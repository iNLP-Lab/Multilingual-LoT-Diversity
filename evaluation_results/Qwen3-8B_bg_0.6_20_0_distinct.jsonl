Alice, the cautious leader, insisted on staying close to the trail, while Bob, the adventurous one, raced ahead, eager to find the \"truth.\" Mallory, the quiet thinker, studied the note, whispering, \"The shadows... maybe it\u2019s a riddle about light?\"  \n\nAs they followed the trail, they stumbled upon a crumbling stone archway covered in ivy. The key fit perfectly into a lock on the arch, revealing a hidden room filled with ancient maps and a single glowing crystal. But as they reached for it, the ground shook, and a hidden door slammed shut.  \n\n\"Quick, we need to find another way out!\" Alice shouted. Bob scrambled to the wall, discovering a faint inscription: *\"Only those who share the light may leave.\"* Mallory realized the crystal was the key\u2014its glow could illuminate the path.  \n\nTogether, they used the crystal to light their way, revealing a hidden staircase. As they emerged into the sunlight, the library\u2019s bell chimed, signaling the end of their adventure. Though they never found the \"truth\" they sought, they realized the real treasure was the bond they shared.  \n\nAnd so, the three friends returned home, their hearts full of stories\u2014and a newfound respect for the mysteries that lingered in the shadows.", "**Title: The Forgotten Key**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory met by chance in the dusty halls of the old Lockwood Museum. Alice, a curious inventor, had come to study the museum\u2019s collection of antique locks. Bob, a meticulous historian, was there to catalog a rare set of medieval keys. Mallory, a spirited adventurer, had wandered in after hearing rumors of a hidden chamber.  \n\nTheir paths crossed when Alice noticed a peculiar rusted keyhole in a forgotten wall panel. Bob, intrigued, pointed out that the keyhole matched a design in a 15th-century manuscript he had studied. Mallory, ever the optimist, insisted they try to unlock it.  \n\nAfter hours of debate, Alice rigged a small device to test the keyhole, while Bob cross-referenced the manuscript\u2019s symbols. Mallory, frustrated, accidentally knocked over a display, revealing a hidden compartment containing a weathered map.  \n\nThe map led them to an abandoned estate, where they faced riddles and traps. Alice\u2019s ingenuity solved the mechanical puzzles, Bob\u2019s knowledge deciphered the clues, and Mallory\u2019s boldness navigated the dangers. At the heart of the estate, they found a chest filled not with gold, but with letters from the estate\u2019s original owner\u2014a woman who had hidden her wealth to protect her family during a war.  \n\nThough the treasure was modest, the trio left with more than artifacts. They had forged an unbreakable bond, proving that curiosity, knowledge, and courage could unlock even the oldest secrets.  \n\nAnd so, Alice, Bob, and Mallory returned to the museum, not as strangers, but as legends.", "**Title: The Garden of Secrets**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who grew up in the same village, surrounded by an ancient garden that held their shared memories.

Alice, Bob, and Mallory decided to seek the stone together.  \n\nAs they explored the garden, they discovered a hidden chamber beneath the roots. Inside, they found the stone, glowing faintly. But the chamber also held a riddle: *\"To unlock the past, you must reveal the truth.\"*  \n\nAlice confessed that she had always loved Bob, but feared he would leave for the city. Bob admitted he had never stopped loving her, but had stayed in the village out of guilt for a long-ago mistake. Mallory, who had secretly known about their feelings, revealed she had been protecting them, fearing the curse would destroy their bond.  \n\nThe stone glowed brighter, and the garden bloomed anew. The curse lifted, and the three friends realized their friendship\u2014and love\u2014had always been the true magic.  \n\nThey returned to the village, not as children, but as a family, forever bound by the garden\u2019s secret.", "**Title: The Secret of Willow Creek**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who lived in a quiet village surrounded by forests. One summer, they discovered an old map hidden in Alice\u2019s attic, pointing to a forgotten cave near Willow Creek. Curious, they decided to explore it together.  \n\nBob, the adventurous one, led the way, while Mallory, the quiet thinker, studied the map. Alice, the leader, kept everyone safe. As they ventured deeper into the cave, they found a glowing crystal and a note: *\"Only those who share their treasures will find true joy.\"*  \n\nConfused, they realized the \"treasures\" were not gold, but the memories they shared. They laughed, shared stories, and even sang a silly song.

Alice, the clever strategist, studied the map and deduced the cave\u2019s location. Bob, the fearless explorer, volunteered to lead the way, while Mallory, the cautious planner, brought supplies and ensured their safety.  \n\nAs they trekked through the woods, they faced challenges\u2014a sudden storm, a rickety bridge, and a riddle carved into a tree. Each obstacle tested their strengths: Alice solved the riddle, Bob crossed the bridge, and Mallory guided them through the storm. Finally, they reached the cave, where they found not gold, but a collection of old journals and letters revealing their grandmother\u2019s secret: she had once been an explorer herself.  \n\nThe friends returned home with stories of bravery and friendship, realizing that the real treasure was their bond. From that day on, they vowed to explore together, always trusting one another.  \n\nAnd so, Alice, Bob, and Mallory became legends in Willowbrook\u2014not for the treasure they found, but for the adventure they shared.", "**Title: The Forgotten Key**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who grew up in the quiet town of Willowbrook. Their bond was unbreakable, but as they grew older, life pulled them in different directions. Alice became a librarian, Bob a mechanic, and Mallory a traveling artist.  \n\nOne rainy afternoon, Alice discovered an old letter in her grandmother\u2019s attic, revealing a hidden treasure map to a chest buried near the town\u2019s old orchard. She called Bob and Mallory, hoping to share the discovery.  \n\nAt first, the trio argued\u2014Alice wanted to keep the treasure, Bob insisted on splitting it fairly, and Mallory believed it was a trick. But as they explored the orchard, they found the chest, filled with dusty coins and a faded journal. The journal spoke of a forgotten promise: *\u201cTo those who seek truth, not gold, the heart of the town shall reveal its secret.\u201d*  \n\nIn a moment of clarity, they realized the real treasure was their friendship. They buried the chest again, choosing instead to rebuild the bond they\u2019d lost.  \n\nYears later, the trio reunited at the orchard, now a community garden. Alice read the journal aloud, Bob laughed at their old arguments, and Mallory painted a mural of their adventure. The treasure was never the gold\u2014it was the memories they\u2019d rediscovered.  \n\nAnd so, in Willowbrook, the three friends learned that some secrets are best left buried, but the heart of friendship is always unearthed.", "**Title: The Forgotten Box**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who had grown apart over the years. One rainy afternoon, they reunited at Alice\u2019s cottage, seeking comfort from the chaos of adult life. While rummaging through the attic, they stumbled upon an old, dust-covered box. Curious, they opened it to find a collection of yellowed letters and faded photographs.  \n\nThe letters were addressed to all three, but the handwriting was unfamiliar. As they read, a mystery unfolded: the letters revealed a secret society that had once existed in their town, one that had vanished decades ago. The photographs showed their ancestors, but the faces were eerily similar to their own.  \n\nBob, the skeptic, dismissed the letters as a hoax. Mallory, however, grew increasingly obsessed, convinced the messages were a warning. Alice, torn between logic and curiosity, tried to mediate. But as the days passed, strange occurrences began\u2014clocks stopped, shadows moved, and whispers echoed in the walls.  \n\nWhen Mallory vanished one night, Alice and Bob searched the town, uncovering clues that linked the society to a hidden chamber beneath the cottage. They found Mallory trapped, her mind fractured by the truth: the letters were a test, and the society had been a cult that manipulated generations.  \n\nIn the end, Alice and Bob destroyed the box, freeing themselves from its grip. Mallory, though scarred, emerged with a fragile hope. The friends never spoke of the night again, but the mystery lingered\u2014a reminder that some secrets are best left buried.", "**Title: The Forgotten Path**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory had been friends since childhood, bound by a shared love for adventure. One summer, they stumbled upon an old map in Bob\u2019s attic, leading to a mysterious forest rumored to hold a hidden treasure. Skeptical but curious, Alice agreed to the journey, while Bob, ever the optimist, insisted it was just a legend. Mallory, however, was determined to prove the map real.  \n\nThe trio ventured deep into the woods, where the trees grew taller and the air grew colder. After hours of hiking, they found a crumbling stone archway, half-buried in vines. Mallory deciphered the map\u2019s final clue and pushed the arch open, revealing a narrow path descending into darkness.  \n\nInside, the trio encountered a glowing cavern filled with bioluminescent fungi. At its center stood a pedestal holding a weathered compass. Alice hesitated, recalling tales of treasure hunters who vanished in the woods. Bob laughed, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve come this far\u2014let\u2019s see what\u2019s next.\u201d Mallory, ever the strategist, studied the compass, its needle spinning wildly.  \n\nSuddenly, the ground trembled. A hidden door slid open, revealing a staircase leading upward. The trio climbed, emerging into a sunlit meadow\u2014only to find their own village, but altered. The trees were taller, the buildings older, and a single clock tower stood where their school once was.  \n\nConfused, Alice whispered, \u201cWe\u2019ve traveled through time.\u201d Bob grinned, \u201cOr maybe the forest just wanted us to find this.\u201d Mallory, ever the thinker, adjusted the compass. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a treasure\u2014it\u2019s a message.

Inside was a dusty key and a note: *\u201cTo unlock the truth, you must trust one another.\u201d*  \n\nAs they debated what to do next, a storm broke out. The key fit a lock on a nearby old cabin, and they raced to protect it from the rain.

{"idx": 46, "question": "What's a saying that English teachers hate?", "responses": ["The saying that English teachers hate is \"saying.\" This is a play on words, as \"saying\" can refer to a phrase or expression (like \"the early bird catches the worm\"), but in this context, it's a pun on the word \"saying\" itself. English teachers might dislike the misuse of \"saying\" as a standalone word when it should be part of a phrase or sentence.", "\"I seen it\" is a saying that English teachers hate because it's grammatically incorrect. The correct form is \"I saw it,\" as \"seen\" is a past participle and requires an auxiliary verb (e.g., \"have\" or \"had\") to form the past perfect tense. \"I seen it\" is a common mistake that reflects a misunderstanding of verb tenses.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could have gone to the store, but I chose to stay home.\"** This is a common example of a sentence that appears grammatically correct but contains a logical inconsistency. The phrase \"could have gone\" implies a past possibility, while \"chose to stay home\" suggests a deliberate decision, which creates a contradiction in meaning. Teachers often use this as a teaching example to highlight the importance of clarity and logical consistency in writing.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly misused because \"could\" implies ability, while the intended meaning is \"I couldn't care less\" (meaning \"I don't care at all\"). The confusion arises from mixing the meanings of \"could\" (can) and \"couldn't\" (cannot). Teachers often highlight this as a common grammar mistake.", "\"I could care less.\"  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it is grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"I couldn't care less\" is the correct form, as \"couldn't\" (could not) emphasizes a complete lack of care, while \"could care less\" (which is a misused phrase) implies a minimal level of concern. The confusion arises from the use of \"could\" versus \"couldn't,\" making it a common target for correction in grammar lessons.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"Don't cry over spilt milk.\"** While it's a common idiom meaning \"don't worry about things you can't change,\" some teachers find it overused, clich\u00e9d, or inappropriate for certain contexts. It's a classic example of a phrase that's both familiar and frequently criticized in language education.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I before E except after C\"**. This rule is notorious for being tricky and frequently misapplied, especially in words like *Wednesday* or *Wednesday*, where the rule seems to break down. It\u2019s a common source of frustration for both teachers and students! \ud83d\ude0a", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is grammatically incorrect because \"could care less\" implies a degree of care, whereas the intended meaning is \"I couldn't care less\" (meaning \"I don't care at all\"). Teachers hate this error because it misuses the modal verb \"could\" to express a complete lack of interest.", "\"I could have been a contender\" is a saying that English teachers often hate, as it's frequently misused or overused in contexts where it doesn't fit grammatically or logically. It's famously from *The Godfather* and is often cited as an example of incorrect language use.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly misused because \"could care less\" implies a degree of care, whereas the correct expression is **\"I couldn't care less\"**, which means \"I don't care at all.\" Teachers hate it because it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the grammatical structure of the modal verb \"could.\"", "The saying that English teachers often hate is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly misused because it implies a willingness to care less (i.e., \"I could care less\" = \"I can care less\"), but the correct expression is **\"I couldn't care less\"**, which means \"I don't care at all.\" Teachers dislike it because it reflects a misunderstanding of the grammatical structure.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I'm not a teacher, I'm a student.\"** This is a humorous twist on the idea that students might avoid taking responsibility for their learning by claiming they are not \"teachers\" but rather \"students,\" which can be seen as a way to dodge accountability. While it's not a traditional saying, it's a common joke in educational settings.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly misused to mean \"I don't care at all,\" but it actually implies \"I care a little.\" The correct expression is **\"I couldn't care less\"**, which clearly conveys indifference. Students often use the incorrect version, which frustrates teachers.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"** This phrase is sometimes misused or overused by students as an excuse for not following grammar rules or proper language usage, which frustrates teachers.", "\"I could care less\" is a common saying that English teachers often dislike. It's frequently misused to express that someone doesn't care at all, but the phrase is grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase is \"I couldn't care less,\" which uses \"couldn't\" (meaning \"cannot\") to convey the intended meaning.", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I have few time\"**. This is a grammatical error because \"few\" is used with countable nouns (e.g., \"few books\"), while \"time\" is uncountable. The correct phrase is **\"I have little time\"** or **\"I have few times\"** (if referring to multiple instances). Students often misuse \"few\" with uncountable nouns, which frustrates teachers.", "The saying is \"English teachers hate English.\" This is a play on words where \"English\" refers to the language (the subject) and \"English teachers\" refers to the people teaching it. The humor comes from the double meaning of the word \"English,\" creating a paradoxical statement that English teachers might find amusing or confusing.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I saw her duck.\"** This is a common example of a grammatically incorrect sentence, where \"duck\" is used as a verb (to move quickly) instead of a noun (the bird). It highlights a mix-up between the two meanings of the word, which can be confusing for learners and frustrating for teachers.", "\"I hate English teachers.\"  \n\nThis is a play on words, as the question itself is phrased as a statement (\"What's a saying...\"), and the answer is a statement that English teachers might dislike hearing from students.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:  \n\n1. **Base Engine Sound**: Start with a low-frequency engine rumble (around 80-120 Hz) to mimic the growl of a car engine.  \n2. **Engine Revving**: Add a rising pitch (e.g., 200-500 Hz) to simulate the engine revving as the car accelerates.  \n3. **Tire Screech**: Overlay a high-pitched screech (1-3 kHz) for the tires skidding or gripping the road.  \n4. **Wind Noise**: Add a low-frequency wind hum (100-300 Hz) to simulate the rush of air.  \n5. **Doppler Effect**: Use a pitch-shift tool to create a rising tone (as the car approaches) and a falling tone (as it moves away).  \n6. **Ambient Noise**: Layer subtle background sounds like road vibrations or distant traffic.  \n\n**Example Code (Python with PyDub)**:  \n```python\nfrom pydub import AudioSegment\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Generate base engine sound (sine wave)\nengine = AudioSegment.silent(duration=1000)\nengine = engine.set_frame_rate(44100)\nengine = engine.set_sample_width(2)\nengine = engine.set_channels(1)\n\n# Add engine revving (rising frequency)\nt = np.linspace(0, 1, 44100, False)\nfreq = 200 + 300 * t  # Rises from 200 Hz to 500 Hz\nengine = AudioSegment(\n    (np.sin(2 * np.pi * freq * t) * 32767).astype(np.int16).tobytes(),\n    frame_rate=44100,\n    sample_width=2,\n    channels=1\n)\n\n# Add tire screech (high-frequency burst)\nscreech = AudioSegment.silent(duration=200)\nscreech = screech.set_frame_rate(44100)\nscreech = screech.set_sample_width(2)\nscreech = screech.set_channels(1)\nscreech = AudioSegment(\n    (np.sin(2 * np.pi * 4000 * t[:200]) * 32767).astype(np.int16).tobytes(),\n    frame_rate=44100,\n    sample_width=2,\n    channels=1\n)\n\n# Combine all layers\nfinal = engine + screech\nfinal.export(\"car_passing.wav\", format=\"wav\")\n```  \n\n**Alternative**: Use online tools like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) to find pre-made car pass sounds or use a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Audacity to layer and edit sounds.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation or adjustments! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8"], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 1], "distinct": 7, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.07187909632921219], [[0, 2], 0.07249141484498978], [[0, 3], 0.086875781416893], [[0, 4], 0.06357339769601822], [[0, 5], 0.1021977961063385], [[0, 6], 0.08885815739631653], [[0, 7], 0.06431728601455688], [[0, 8], 0.11808378249406815], [[0, 9], 0.07403533905744553], [[0, 10], 0.11760996282100677], [[0, 11], 0.059594593942165375], [[0, 12], 0.0754765123128891], [[0, 13], 0.08447504788637161], [[0, 14], 0.1881631761789322], [[0, 15], 0.07465262711048126], [[0, 16], 0.1672164350748062], [[0, 17], 0.35020312666893005], [[0, 18], 0.08321364223957062], [[0, 19], 0.059881072491407394], [[1, 2], 0.059377603232860565], [[1, 3], 0.06428749114274979], [[1, 4], 0.91990727186203], [[1, 6], 0.07661812752485275], [[1, 7], 0.890936017036438], [[1, 9], 0.07440533488988876], [[1, 11], 0.5847747325897217], [[1, 12], 0.05992211773991585], [[1, 13], 0.353911817073822], [[1, 15], 0.05799261853098869], [[1, 18], 0.057547979056835175], [[1, 19], 0.16370496153831482], [[2, 3], 0.0627591609954834], [[2, 6], 0.06476179510354996], [[2, 9], 0.06254270672798157], [[2, 12], 0.0644146278500557], [[2, 15], 0.06132010370492935], [[2, 18], 0.06215083971619606], [[3, 6], 0.837084949016571], [[3, 9], 0.06818460673093796], [[3, 12], 0.07258471846580505], [[3, 15], 0.08009446412324905], [[3, 18], 0.06847399473190308], [[9, 12], 0.06419868022203445], [[9, 15], 0.06551457196474075], [[9, 18], 0.08251752704381943], [[12, 15], 0.06756250560283661], [[12, 18], 0.06844457983970642], [[15, 18], 0.07908076792955399]]}
