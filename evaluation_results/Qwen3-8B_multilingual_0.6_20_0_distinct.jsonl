Alice\u2019s words painted vivid scenes, Bob\u2019s math ensured the garden thrived, and Mallory\u2019s art brought it all to life. On the day of the presentation, the class was captivated by their teamwork and creativity.  \n\nThough they had started as rivals, the project taught them that collaboration could turn chaos into magic.

Alice, a quiet botanist, had spent years studying the rare flora of the Whispering Forest. Bob, a brash adventurer, had heard tales of the forest\u2019s hidden magic and insisted they explore it. Mallory, a skeptical cartographer, had only joined to map the terrain\u2014until she stumbled upon a strange symbol etched into a tree.  \n\nThe trio entered the forest, where the trees seemed to hum with an ancient energy. Alice noticed the symbols matched those in her journals, but they were *alive*, shifting as they moved. Bob, ever the optimist, joked, \u201cMaybe the forest is trying to tell us something.\u201d Mallory, ever the pragmatist, muttered, \u201cOr it\u2019s trying to trap us.\u201d  \n\nAs they ventured deeper, the forest grew darker, and the air thickened with a low, melodic whisper. Suddenly, the ground trembled, and a glowing door materialized before them. Alice hesitated, but Bob stepped forward. \u201cWe\u2019ve come this far,\u201d he said. Mallory, though unsure, nodded.  \n\nInside, they found a library filled with floating books and a single, ancient tome. The book\u2019s pages turned themselves, revealing a map to a forgotten sanctuary. But the final page warned: *\u201cOnly those who listen may pass.\u201d*  \n\nAlice, who had always been the quietest, whispered, \u201cThe forest is alive. It\u2019s *talking* to us.\u201d The door glowed, and the trio stepped through.  \n\nThey emerged in a sunlit clearing, where a stone archway bore the same symbol Mallory had found. The forest had tested them, and they had passed\u2014not through strength, but through understanding. As they left, Bob grinned. \u201cNext time, let\u2019s find the library\u2019s secret.\u201d Mallory smirked. \u201cOnly if Alice agrees to stop talking about plants.\u201d Alice laughed, and for the first time, the forest seemed to hum in harmony with them.  \n\n---  \n*The end.*", "**Title: The Forgotten Clocktower**  \n\nIn the quiet village of Willowbrook, three friends\u2014Alice, Bob, and Mallory\u2014spent their afternoons exploring the old clocktower that loomed over the town. Alice, a curious 12-year-old, loved solving puzzles. Bob, a quiet inventor, always had a gadget in his pocket. Mallory, the group\u2019s skeptic, often rolled her eyes at their antics.  \n\nOne rainy afternoon, they discovered a rusted key hidden beneath the tower\u2019s stairs. Alice insisted it belonged to the tower\u2019s long-forgotten mechanism, while Bob theorized it was a lock for a hidden room. Mallory, ever the pragmatist, suggested they abandon the quest.  \n\nBut Alice\u2019s determination won. They climbed the creaky stairs, dodging spiders and whispers of the tower\u2019s past. At the top, they found a dusty compartment containing a broken clock and a note: *\u201cTime is a river, not a cage.\u201d*  \n\nBob repaired the clock, its gears whirring to life. As it ticked, the tower\u2019s walls shimmered, revealing a hidden garden\u2014once the town\u2019s heart, now overgrown. Mallory, for once, smiled. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not just explorers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re caretakers.\u201d  \n\nThey spent the day restoring the garden, their laughter echoing through the tower. Though the clock stopped again, the friends knew they\u2019d uncovered something far more valuable than treasure: the joy of discovery together.  \n\nAnd so, the clocktower stood as a reminder that time, like friendship, is best shared.", "**Title: The Secret Garden**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were three friends who lived in a small village surrounded by lush green hills. One summer, they discovered an old, overgrown garden hidden behind a crumbling wall near the village edge. Curious, they decided to explore it together.  \n\nAlice, the adventurous one, led the way, her heart racing with excitement. Bob, the cautious thinker, checked for dangers like thorns or traps. Mallory, the quiet but observant girl, noticed details others missed\u2014like a faded sign reading *\"For the brave.\"*  \n\nAs they cleared the garden, they found a hidden treasure: a map to a mythical spring said to grant wishes. But the map was incomplete, and the spring\u2019s location was a mystery.  \n\nDetermined, the trio worked together. Alice\u2019s courage, Bob\u2019s logic, and Mallory\u2019s intuition guided them. They solved riddles, avoided pitfalls, and finally reached the spring. To their surprise, it wasn\u2019t magical\u2014it was a natural spring with crystal-clear water.  \n\nThey shared a laugh, realizing the real treasure was their friendship. From that day on, the garden became their sanctuary, a place where their strengths united to create something beautiful.  \n\nAnd though they never found a magical wish, they found something far greater: the joy of teamwork and the magic of shared dreams.", "**Title: The Secret of the Whispering Woods**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who had always shared a bond stronger than blood. One summer, they stumbled upon an old map in Alice\u2019s attic, leading to a hidden glen known as the Whispering Woods. The map hinted at a forgotten treasure buried by a long-lost tribe.  \n\nBob, the adventurous optimist, insisted they follow the map. Mallory, the cautious scholar, warned of dangers, while Alice, the determined leader, balanced their ideas. Together, they ventured into the woods, where the trees seemed to murmur secrets.  \n\nAs they deciphered clues, tensions flared. Bob grew impatient, Mallory doubted their path, and Alice struggled to keep them united. Just when hope faded, they found a cave with a riddle etched on the wall. Mallory solved it, revealing the treasure: not gold, but a journal detailing the tribe\u2019s wisdom.  \n\nThe friends realized the true treasure was their friendship. They returned home, not richer, but wiser, their bond stronger than ever.", "**Title: The Forgotten Map**  \n\nAlice, Bob, and Mallory were childhood friends who had grown apart over the years. One rainy afternoon, they reunited at Alice\u2019s grandmother\u2019s attic, where she discovered an old, yellowed map tucked beneath a stack of dusty books. The map depicted a hidden cave near the woods where Alice used to play as a child.  \n\nCurious and skeptical, Bob joked, \u201cThis is just a kids\u2019 doodle.\u201d But Mallory, ever the optimist, insisted, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s real? We could find something amazing.\u201d Alice, torn between doubt and nostalgia, agreed to the adventure.  \n\nThey set off at dawn, hiking through the woods. Bob, the group\u2019s strategist, studied the map, while Mallory led the way with her fearless energy. When they stumbled into a thorny thicket, Alice used her knowledge of plants to clear a path.  \n\nInside the cave, they found a rusted chest filled with old coins and a letter: *\u201cTo those who seek truth, not treasure\u2014trust your friends.\u201d* As they emerged, the sun broke through the trees, casting golden light on their faces.  \n\nThough they never found gold, they found something far greater: the joy of reconnecting and the strength of their bond.  \n\n**The End.**"], "partition": [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5, 0], "distinct": 7, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.06819964945316315], [[0, 2], 0.125890851020813], [[0, 3], 0.07267336547374725], [[0, 4], 0.850763738155365], [[0, 5], 0.45316553115844727], [[0, 6], 0.17664940655231476], [[0, 7], 0.656642735004425], [[0, 8], 0.06537001579999924], [[0, 9], 0.0675072968006134], [[0, 10], 0.0664672777056694], [[0, 11], 0.0907289981842041], [[0, 12], 0.07488390058279037], [[0, 13], 0.10098915547132492], [[0, 14], 0.4217770993709564], [[1, 3], 0.06453181058168411], [[1, 8], 0.06959807872772217], [[1, 9], 0.06972967833280563], [[1, 10], 0.07994850724935532], [[1, 11], 0.06853774935007095], [[1, 12], 0.09867537021636963], [[1, 13], 0.07662507146596909], [[3, 8], 0.06543787568807602], [[3, 9], 0.06695925444364548], [[3, 10], 0.06898973137140274], [[3, 11], 0.0742814764380455], [[3, 12], 0.06371902674436569], [[3, 13], 0.08208690583705902], [[8, 9], 0.06843157112598419], [[8, 10], 0.06594295799732208], [[8, 11], 0.06685599684715271], [[8, 12], 0.06515530496835709], [[8, 13], 0.06494005769491196], [[9, 10], 0.0693075880408287], [[9, 11], 0.06961283087730408], [[9, 12], 0.06940775364637375], [[9, 13], 0.0665363296866417], [[10, 11], 0.07313679903745651], [[10, 12], 0.08383046835660934], [[10, 13], 0.5718939304351807], [[11, 12], 0.08945810049772263]]}

This breed is known for its independent, aloof nature and strong will, making training challenging. They are not easily trainable and may not respond well to basic commands. Additionally, Basenjis are high-energy and require significant mental stimulation and exercise, which can be overwhelming for someone new to dog ownership. Their unique \"barkless\" vocalization and tendency to be stubborn further add to the difficulty of managing them without prior experience. Other breeds like the Siberian Husky or Australian Shepherd are also high-maintenance, but the Basenji's independent personality makes it particularly unsuitable for first-timers.", "The **Border Collie** is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner.

Always prioritize breeds with lower energy levels, easier temperaments, and minimal training demands for novice owners.", "The dog breed that is least well-suited for a first-time dog owner is often considered to be the **Saint Bernard** or **Great Dane**. These large breeds require significant space, regular exercise, and proper training due to their size and energy levels. They can also be prone to health issues like hip dysplasia, which may require more veterinary care. Additionally, their size makes them challenging to manage in small living spaces or for owners with limited physical ability. Other breeds like the **Border Collie** (high energy and intelligence) or **Bulldog** (potential breathing issues and stubbornness) are also often cited as less ideal for first-time owners.

However, certain breeds are generally considered more challenging for first-time owners due to their high energy levels, training requirements, or specific temperaments. For example:\n\n1. **Bernese Mountain Dog**: These large, gentle giants require significant space, time, and attention. Their size and potential for separation anxiety make them unsuitable for inexperienced owners.\n2. **Rottweiler**: While loyal and protective, they demand consistent training, socialization, and firm leadership. Their strength and potential for aggression if not properly trained can be overwhelming for novices.\n3. **Pit Bull Terrier**: Despite their friendly nature, they require structured training and socialization to prevent behavioral issues. Their high energy and need for mental stimulation can be demanding.\n4. **Border Collie**: These highly intelligent and energetic dogs need constant mental and physical activity. Without proper engagement, they may become destructive or bored.\n5. **Great Dane**: Their large size, sensitivity, and need for a calm environment make them challenging for first-time owners who may lack experience in managing such a big dog.\n\n**Key Considerations**:  \n- **Energy Levels**: Breeds with high energy (e.g., Border Collies) require daily exercise and mental stimulation.  \n- **Training Needs**: Breeds requiring advanced training (e.g., Rottweilers) need experienced handlers.  \n- **Temperament**: Breeds with strong protective instincts or potential for aggression (e.g., Pit Bulls) need careful handling.  \n- **Size and Space**: Large breeds (e.g., Great Danes) require ample living space and proper care.  \n\n**Conclusion**: While no breed is inherently \"bad\" for a first-time owner, breeds like the **Bernese Mountain Dog**, **Rottweiler**, or **Border Collie** are often cited as less suitable due to their specific needs. First-time owners should prioritize breeds with lower energy, easier training, and adaptability (e.g., Bulldogs, Beagles, or Cavalier King Charles Spaniels) and thoroughly research the breed's requirements before adoption.

The correct expression is **\"I couldn't care less,\"** which emphasizes a complete lack of concern. Teachers often correct this misuse because it reflects a misunderstanding of the difference between \"could\" (ability) and \"couldn't\" (lack of ability).  \n\nAnother example could be **\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do,\"** which might be disliked if students use it to justify culturally insensitive behavior. However, the most frequently cited answer is **\"I could care less\"** due to its widespread misuse.", "**\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because students frequently misuse it to justify inappropriate behavior, implying that following local customs is always acceptable, even when it contradicts universal values or rules.

Maybe I can use a simple method like counting to 20 and stopping at a random point. Alternatively, I can use a random number generator. But since I'm doing this manually, I'll just pick a number. Let me check... 17. \n\nHmm, maybe I should use a more systematic approach. Let me count from 1 to 20 and pick the 13th number. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
