The \"hardest\" program ultimately depends on individual goals, background, and the specific criteria of the institution."], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 4, 15], "distinct": 15, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.05286232382059097], [[0, 2], 0.053371842950582504], [[0, 3], 0.05200277268886566], [[0, 4], 0.05521995946764946], [[0, 5], 0.05399010330438614], [[0, 6], 0.051731668412685394], [[0, 7], 0.05379240959882736], [[0, 8], 0.05159023776650429], [[0, 9], 0.05358060449361801], [[0, 10], 0.05317438766360283], [[0, 11], 0.05322287604212761], [[0, 12], 0.05196718871593475], [[0, 13], 0.05288181081414223], [[0, 14], 0.05290825292468071], [[0, 15], 0.051697783172130585], [[0, 16], 0.05742161348462105], [[0, 17], 0.053982608020305634], [[0, 18], 0.06151366978883743], [[1, 2], 0.05645914003252983], [[1, 3], 0.05406225472688675], [[1, 4], 0.0536736324429512], [[1, 5], 0.11405455321073532], [[1, 6], 0.054518211632966995], [[1, 7], 0.05327053740620613], [[1, 8], 0.3100108802318573], [[1, 9], 0.05646302551031113], [[1, 10], 0.055935006588697433], [[1, 11], 0.05390796810388565], [[1, 12], 0.053354501724243164], [[1, 13], 0.08962253481149673], [[1, 14], 0.0543334074318409], [[1, 15], 0.05321855843067169], [[1, 16], 0.05347781628370285], [[1, 17], 0.053183414041996], [[1, 18], 0.05435578152537346], [[2, 3], 0.05312620475888252], [[2, 4], 0.053473833948373795], [[2, 6], 0.05155770108103752], [[2, 7], 0.05277153104543686], [[2, 9], 0.05778169631958008], [[2, 10], 0.0553722120821476], [[2, 11], 0.05597296729683876], [[2, 12], 0.05389890819787979], [[2, 13], 0.0585155263543129], [[2, 14], 0.05353785306215286], [[2, 15], 0.05177072063088417], [[2, 16], 0.05311351269483566], [[2, 17], 0.05435337871313095], [[2, 18], 0.05283236876130104], [[3, 4], 0.0526653490960598], [[3, 6], 0.06619758158922195], [[3, 7], 0.05281201750040054], [[3, 9], 0.05647067353129387], [[3, 10], 0.053589288145303726], [[3, 11], 0.055338215082883835], [[3, 12], 0.05920672044157982], [[3, 13], 0.058883167803287506], [[3, 14], 0.05349848046898842], [[3, 15], 0.05354727432131767], [[3, 16], 0.05311119183897972], [[3, 17], 0.05312095209956169], [[3, 18], 0.05269033834338188], [[4, 6], 0.051857832819223404], [[4, 7], 0.057238444685935974], [[4, 9], 0.056400641798973083], [[4, 10], 0.05367358401417732], [[4, 11], 0.05811859294772148], [[4, 12], 0.053071968257427216], [[4, 13], 0.05365690216422081], [[4, 14], 0.05316024646162987], [[4, 15], 0.051635611802339554], [[4, 16], 0.07804302126169205], [[4, 17], 0.11757873743772507], [[4, 18], 0.05417739972472191], [[6, 7], 0.05106304585933685], [[6, 9], 0.05472509190440178], [[6, 10], 0.0519348680973053], [[6, 11], 0.05164573714137077], [[6, 12], 0.05240967124700546], [[6, 13], 0.052874334156513214], [[6, 14], 0.05438698083162308], [[6, 15], 0.05052733048796654], [[6, 16], 0.05174598842859268], [[6, 18], 0.052136775106191635], [[7, 9], 0.05366756021976471], [[7, 10], 0.0530359148979187], [[7, 11], 0.061750415712594986], [[7, 12], 0.05247057229280472], [[7, 13], 0.053529709577560425], [[7, 14], 0.05322713404893875], [[7, 15], 0.05163601040840149], [[7, 16], 0.05651663988828659], [[7, 18], 0.05450756102800369], [[9, 10], 0.05268985033035278], [[9, 11], 0.05907336249947548], [[9, 12], 0.05486011132597923], [[9, 13], 0.05374464392662048], [[9, 14], 0.05333070084452629], [[9, 15], 0.05156698077917099], [[9, 16], 0.06342523545026779], [[9, 18], 0.053256213665008545], [[10, 11], 0.05242210254073143], [[10, 12], 0.05265851691365242], [[10, 13], 0.055586740374565125], [[10, 14], 0.053459715098142624], [[10, 15], 0.05209522321820259], [[10, 16], 0.053403668105602264], [[10, 18], 0.05309908464550972], [[11, 12], 0.07166888564825058], [[11, 13], 0.054253336042165756], [[11, 14], 0.052682433277368546], [[11, 15], 0.05186982825398445], [[11, 16], 0.054922908544540405], [[11, 18], 0.06766127049922943], [[12, 13], 0.05370610952377319], [[12, 14], 0.053461696952581406], [[12, 15], 0.05207335576415062], [[12, 16], 0.052615873515605927], [[12, 18], 0.054643549025058746], [[13, 14], 0.05407750979065895], [[13, 15], 0.05199256166815758], [[13, 16], 0.05240273103117943], [[13, 18], 0.05330049619078636], [[14, 15], 0.053239692002534866], [[14, 16], 0.0530405268073082], [[14, 18], 0.05362515151500702], [[15, 16], 0.051475804299116135], [[15, 18], 0.052657000720500946], [[16, 18], 0.05745130777359009]]}

Panicked, Alice nearly gave up, but Bob quickly diagnosed the issue: a loose cable. Mallory, ever the optimist, rallied the crowd to keep the mood upbeat while Bob fixed the problem.  \n\nWhen the music finally played, Alice\u2019s voice filled the room, and Mallory cheered from the front row. Though the concert wasn\u2019t perfect, it was unforgettable.

One rainy afternoon, Alice found an old, yellowed map in her grandmother\u2019s attic. It depicted a hidden grove deep in the woods, marked with a cryptic symbol: a key. Intrigued, she invited Bob and Mallory to join her on a quest to uncover its secret.  \n\nThe trio ventured into the forest, navigating through tangled paths and whispering trees. Bob, the cautious one, insisted they stay on marked trails, while Mallory, the adventurous spirit, argued that the map required boldness. Alice, the mediator, balanced their opinions, recalling how they once solved a puzzle together as kids.  \n\nAs they reached the grove, they discovered a weathered stone with a lock. Mallory noticed the symbol matched the map, and Bob found a rusted key in a nearby hollow log. Alice, with a sly grin, revealed the key was a riddle: \u201cOnly the heart that listens finds the door.\u201d  \n\nThey worked together, unlocking the stone to reveal a small chest containing a faded journal.

Alice, a curious botanist, believed every leaf held a secret. Bob, a pragmatic engineer, dismissed such notions as childish. Mallory, a cynical artist, found humor in their debates. One autumn, they stumbled upon an ancient map in a dusty library, pointing to a hidden grove in the Whispering Forest.  \n\nDriven by curiosity, they ventured into the woods. The trees seemed to hum, and the air shimmered with unspoken stories. Alice insisted the forest was alive, while Bob muttered about faulty sensors. Mallory, sketching the scene, noticed a faint symbol carved into a tree\u2014matching the map.  \n\nAs they followed the trail, a storm erupted. Seeking shelter, they discovered a crumbling stone door, sealed with the same symbol. Bob\u2019s tools failed, and Alice\u2019s knowledge of plants revealed a moss that glowed under pressure. Mallory, ever the skeptic, laughed until the moss lit the path.  \n\nInside, they found a chamber with a pedestal holding a single, glowing crystal. The walls whispered in a language none could understand. Alice reached for it, but Bob stopped her. \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a trap?\u201d he asked. Mallory, voice trembling, whispered, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s the only truth we\u2019ve ever known?\u201d  \n\nThey debated until the crystal pulsed, revealing a vision: a world where curiosity, logic, and artistry coexisted. The forest, they realized, was a test.  \n\nIn the end, they left the crystal, choosing to carry its lesson instead. Alice kept the map, Bob studied the moss, and Mallory painted the forest\u2019s whispers.

Alice, a sharp-witted engineer, had once dreamed of restoring the Earth\u2019s forests. Bob, a quiet programmer, had built a device to decode ancient data. Mallory, a curious botanist, had secretly studied the last surviving trees.  \n\nWhen a mysterious signal disrupted their city\u2019s systems, they discovered a hidden message: *\u201cThe roots remember.\u201d* Following the signal, they ventured into the Overgrown Wilds, a forest rumored to be alive. There, they found a tree with glowing roots and a machine humming with forgotten code.  \n\nAlice deciphered the message: the forest held a blueprint for Earth\u2019s original ecosystem. Bob connected the device, revealing the tree was a seed bank of life. Mallory, trembling, whispered, \u201cWe can\u2019t just take it\u2014we have to *grow* it.\u201d  \n\nTogether, they planted the seed in the city\u2019s heart, merging technology and nature.

Curious, they followed a map Alice had found in her grandmother\u2019s attic, leading them to a moss-covered chest hidden beneath a tree.  \n\nThe chest was locked, its mechanism rusted and unyielding. Alice, the clever one, examined the lock and noticed a faint engraving of a key. Bob, the handyman of the group, tried prying it open with a rock, but it only deepened the crack.

Inside lay a single, weathered key and a note: *\u201cTo unlock the future, you must unlock each other.\u201d*  \n\nThey laughed, realizing the treasure was never the key, but the bond they had rekindled.

Bob grinned, \"It\u2019s a treasure map!\" Mallory rolled her eyes, \"Or a prank. Let\u2019s just leave it.\"  \n\nBut Alice, ever the optimist, insisted on opening it. Inside lay a faded letter and a small key. The letter spoke of a hidden chest containing a family heirloom, lost during a shipwreck. The trio, now intrigued, decided to follow the clues.  \n\nDays turned into weeks as they searched the cliffs, arguing over directions and interpretations. Bob\u2019s enthusiasm clashed with Mallory\u2019s caution, while Alice mediated, her patience wearing thin. Yet, as they uncovered fragments of the story, they began to understand the weight of the past\u2014and each other.  \n\nFinally, they found the chest, buried beneath a crumbling lighthouse.

Bob, who was shy and clumsy, accidentally spilled flour on the floor. Mallory, the creative one, laughed and suggested using the flour to make a decorative design.  \n\nAs they worked, Alice guided Bob through the steps, while Mallory added whimsical touches\u2014sprinkles shaped like stars and a ribbon tied in a bow.

Inside, they found a locked room with a puzzle: a clock face, three gears, and a note reading, *\u201cAlign the hands to the past, present, and future.\u201d*  \n\nAlice studied the clock, recalling her history lessons. \u201cThe past is 3 o\u2019clock\u2014when the tower was built,\u201d she said. Bob adjusted the gears, calculating the mechanics. \u201cThe present is 12 o\u2019clock\u2014now,\u201d he added.

{"idx": 46, "question": "What's a saying that English teachers hate?", "responses": ["The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I speak English, but I'm not a native speaker.\"** This phrase is commonly used as a way to avoid taking responsibility for language accuracy or to deflect criticism, which can frustrate teachers who value clear communication and precision. It's a humorous take on the idea of using a \"safe\" excuse to avoid accountability for language mistakes.", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is frequently misused because it implies a lack of concern, but the correct phrase should be **\"I couldn't care less\"**. The confusion arises from the use of \"could\" versus \"couldn't\" in the context of expressing indifference.  \n\nAnother example is **\"they're\" vs. \"their\" vs. \"there\"**, which is a classic grammar mistake. Teachers often highlight this as a frequent error in sentence structure.  \n\nHowever, if the question refers to a specific, well-known phrase, the most iconic one is likely **\"I could care less\"**.", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less.\"** This phrase is grammatically incorrect because \"care less\" means \"to have less care,\" but the phrase is used to mean \"I don't care at all.\" The correct phrase should be **\"I couldn't care less,\"** which uses \"couldn't\" to express the inability to care. Teachers often highlight this as a classic example of misplaced modifiers and incorrect verb usage.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly used to mean \"I don't care at all,\" but it's grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase should be **\"I couldn't care less\"**, which uses the past tense of \"could\" to emphasize the lack of care. Teachers often point out this error as a common misuse of modal verbs.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I'm gonna\"** instead of **\"I am going to\"**. This is considered informal or incorrect grammar, and teachers may find it frustrating when students use it frequently. Another example is **\"I could care less\"**, which is often misused to mean \"I couldn't care less\" (i.e., \"I don't care at all\"). These phrases are criticized for being lazy or incorrect in formal contexts.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. This phrase is commonly misused because \"care less\" actually means \"have less care,\" but the phrase is intended to mean \"I don\u2019t care at all.\" The correct expression should be **\"I couldn\u2019t care less\"** to convey the intended meaning.

The incorrect use of \"seen\" instead of \"saw\" (the simple past tense) is a frequent mistake, which frustrates teachers who emphasize proper verb tenses.  \n\nAlternatively, another popular example is: **\"I'm gonna\"** instead of **\"I am going to\"**, as it's considered informal and non-standard in formal writing.  \n\nBoth examples highlight common errors that teachers often address in language instruction.", "A common saying that English teachers might dislike is **\"I am\"** (used instead of \"I'm\"). It's a grammatical error that reflects a lack of contraction knowledge, which teachers often correct.

For maximum security, combine this with a strong lock mechanism (e.g., a high-quality lock with anti-tamper features).  \n\nIf you\u2019re referring to a specific lock model or hacking method, more context would help refine the answer.", "The safest 4-digit lock combination is not a specific number, as security depends on avoiding predictable patterns. However, here are key guidelines:  \n\n1. **Avoid common patterns**: Numbers like 0000, 1234, 1111, or 1212 are widely used and easy to guess.  \n2. **Use randomness**: Choose a combination with no logical sequence (e.g., 3892) and avoid personal information (e.g., birthdays, phone numbers).  \n3. **Avoid sequential numbers**: Patterns like 1234 or 0123 are easier to crack.  \n4. **Use a random generator**: Tools can create truly random 4-digit codes (e.g., 7391).  \n\nNo single combination is inherently \"safest,\" but following these steps minimizes risk. Always ensure the lock itself is secure (e.g., high-quality hardware, anti-tamper features).  \n\n**Final Answer**: There is no universally \"safest\" 4-digit combination, but using a random, non-patterned code (e.g., 7391) and avoiding common sequences enhances security."], "partition": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "distinct": 2, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.5110964775085449], [[0, 2], 0.06768253445625305], [[0, 3], 0.21449095010757446], [[0, 4], 0.7788103818893433], [[0, 5], 0.059827834367752075], [[0, 6], 0.6096445918083191], [[0, 7], 0.9283768534660339], [[0, 8], 0.06407298147678375], [[0, 9], 0.1604926884174347], [[0, 10], 0.8706874847412109], [[0, 11], 0.7940333485603333], [[0, 12], 0.10922840237617493], [[0, 13], 0.0571809783577919], [[0, 14], 0.08255578577518463], [[0, 15], 0.3554984927177429], [[0, 16], 0.781040608882904], [[0, 17], 0.1549197882413864], [[0, 18], 0.906173050403595], [[0, 19], 0.6605905294418335], [[2, 5], 0.10502532124519348], [[2, 8], 0.6536555886268616], [[2, 13], 0.07529699802398682], [[2, 14], 0.23140516877174377]]}
