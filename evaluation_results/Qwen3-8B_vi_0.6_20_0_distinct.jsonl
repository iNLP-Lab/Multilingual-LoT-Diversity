{"idx": 72, "question": "Choose any Python framework in which I can build ResNet from scratch.", "responses": ["If you want to build ResNet from scratch, **PyTorch** is an excellent choice. It offers flexibility and simplicity for custom model development, with dynamic computation graphs and intuitive API design. While **TensorFlow/Keras** can also be used, PyTorch is more beginner-friendly for building models from scratch. Other frameworks like **JAX** or **MXNet** are less common for this task.  \n\n**Answer:**  \nYou can build ResNet from scratch using **PyTorch**, which provides the flexibility and tools needed for custom model development.", "You can build ResNet from scratch using **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow/Keras**.  \n\n**PyTorch** is a popular choice for building custom models like ResNet because:  \n1.

{"idx": 46, "question": "What's a saying that English teachers hate?", "responses": ["A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I am going to the store\"**. While it may seem simple, this phrase can be misused or misunderstood in context. For example, if someone says, \"I am going to the store,\" it might be interpreted as a future action (e.g., \"I will go to the store\"), but in casual speech, it can also imply a present intention. However, the phrase itself isn't inherently wrong, so the dislike might stem from overuse, ambiguity, or confusion with similar structures like \"I'm going to the store\" (correct) versus \"I'm going to the store\" (incorrect if the speaker is already at the store).  \n\nAlternatively, another humorous answer might be **\"I seen that\"** (incorrect) versus **\"I saw that\"** (correct), as it highlights a common grammar mistake. But the most likely intended answer is **\"I am going to the store\"** due to its frequent misuse or confusion.", "\"I saw her duck.\"  \n\nThis is a common example of a sentence that English teachers dislike because it demonstrates a grammatical error. The confusion arises between the verb \"to duck\" (to avoid or bend down) and the noun \"duck\" (a bird). The sentence implies a misunderstanding of the correct usage of these words, which can be frustrating for teachers who emphasize proper grammar.", "**\"I'm not lazy, I'm just tired.\"**  \nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it's a common excuse students use to avoid responsibility, implying they don't care about their work rather than acknowledging they need to improve their habits.

It\u2019s a humorous way to mock the idea of accountability. \ud83d\ude0a", "**\"I am American.\"**  \nThis is a common joke among English teachers because it's grammatically incorrect. Native speakers typically say \"I'm from America\" or \"I'm American\" (as an adjective), but the phrase \"I am American\" is often used incorrectly in this context, leading to confusion.", "**\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it can be misinterpreted or used inappropriately. While it literally means \"Adapt to local customs when visiting a new place,\" students might take it to mean \"Do whatever others do without thinking,\" which undermines the importance of learning proper language usage and critical thinking. Teachers prefer sayings that encourage thoughtful engagement with the language rather than passive mimicry.", "\"I didn't do it.\"  \n\nThis is a common phrase that English teachers often dislike because it reflects a lack of accountability or an attempt to avoid responsibility, which can be frustrating in a classroom setting.", "\"I'm not a morning person.\"  \n\nThis phrase is often misunderstood by students, who might use it to justify being late or not wanting to wake up early. However, the phrase actually means someone who prefers to stay up late and isn't naturally an early riser. English teachers might dislike it because of this common misinterpretation.", "A common saying that English teachers might dislike is **\"I'm not lazy, I'm just tired\"**\u2014because it's a grammatically incorrect way to express a lack of motivation. Teachers often correct such phrases to emphasize proper grammar and clarity.", "A common saying that English teachers might dislike is **\"I didn't say it, I just said it.\"** This phrase is often used to justify incorrect grammar or pronunciation, which can frustrate teachers who emphasize accuracy. Alternatively, **\"I'm not a native speaker\"** is sometimes used to excuse mistakes, though it's not inherently a \"hate\" phrase. The humor here lies in the irony of using such excuses.", "\"I'm going to\" is a common phrase that English teachers often dislike because students frequently misuse it. For example, saying \"I'm going to school\" instead of \"I'm going to go to school\" is a common mistake. Teachers often correct this because \"I'm going to\" is used for future actions, while \"I'm going to go\" is the correct structure for specifying the action.", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I could care less\"**. While it's commonly used to mean \"I don't care at all,\" grammatically, it's incorrect. The phrase \"care less\" implies a degree of care, so the correct expression would be **\"I couldn't care less\"** to convey indifference. This confusion between the two phrases is a frequent point of frustration for teachers.", "\"I saw her duck.\"  \n\nThis is a classic example of a sentence that English teachers often dislike because it's ambiguous and grammatically confusing. The word \"duck\" can be a noun (the bird) or a verb (to avoid), leading to confusion about whether the sentence means \"I saw her (the bird)\" or \"I saw her (avoid something).\" It's a common mistake that highlights the importance of clarity in language! \ud83d\ude0a", "**\"I am going to\" vs. \"I will\"** is a common source of frustration for English teachers, as students often confuse the two. Another popular one is **\"I have a lot of friends\"** (which is grammatically correct but often used redundantly, as \"many\" is more precise). However, the most iconic answer is: **\"I am going to\"** (used incorrectly for future plans). But the most widely recognized humorous answer is: **\"I am going to\"** (as in, \"I am going to do this, I am going to do that...\").  \n\nHowever, the most commonly cited answer is:  \n**\"I am going to\"** (used incorrectly for future plans, e.g., \"I am going to eat pizza\" when \"I will eat pizza\" is more natural).  \n\nBut the most popular and funny one is:  \n**\"I am going to\"** (used in endless repetition, like \"I am going to school, I am going to work, I am going to sleep...\").  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**\"I am going to\"** (used incorrectly or excessively).", "\"I could care less.\"  \n\nThis phrase is often disliked by English teachers because it is grammatically incorrect. The phrase \"care less\" is a double negative, and the correct expression to convey indifference is \"I couldn't care less.\" The confusion arises from the misuse of \"could\" and \"could not\" in this context.", "**\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it's a common phrase that students misinterpret or misuse, especially in contexts where cultural sensitivity or grammatical accuracy is expected. However, it's a well-known idiom, so the humor here lies in the irony of the question itself. If you meant a different saying, feel free to clarify! \ud83d\ude0a", "\"I could care less.\"  \n\nThis phrase is often disliked by English teachers because it's grammatically incorrect. The correct phrase is \"I couldn't care less,\" which means \"I don't care at all.\" The misuse of \"could\" instead of \"couldn't\" is a common error that teachers find frustrating.", "\"I am\" instead of \"I'm\" is a common mistake that English teachers often dislike, as it shows a lack of understanding of contractions.", "\"When the cat's away, the mice will play.\"  \n\nThis saying humorously refers to students misbehaving or not studying when teachers aren't around, which English teachers might find frustrating."], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 1, 12,

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:  \n\n1. **Base Sound**: Start with a car engine revving sound (e.g., a short, low rumble or a quick rev).  \n2. **Tire Noise**: Layer in tire screeching or rolling sounds (e.g., a high-pitched \"rrrrr\" or \"shhh\" depending on speed).  \n3. **Wind/Environment**: Add wind or ambient noise to simulate the car moving through the air.  \n4. **Distance Effect**: Use audio compression or panning to simulate the car moving closer (increasing volume and clarity) and then fading away (lowering volume and adding reverb).  \n5. **Final Touches**: Adjust EQ to emphasize mid-range frequencies for realism and add subtle distortion for a \"speed\" feel.  \n\nIf you\u2019re using software like Audacity, GarageBand, or a DAW, you can record or sample these elements and mix them. For a quick effect, search for \"car pass sound effect\" on free audio libraries (e.g., freesound.org) and adjust the volume/panning to create movement.  \n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a script for generating this in a specific tool! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8", "To generate a sound effect of a car passing by, you can use a combination of layered sounds:  \n1. **Engine roar** (low-frequency rumble with a rising pitch).  \n2. **Tire screech** (high-pitched, short burst for acceleration).  \n3. **Wind noise** (hissing or rushing sound as the car moves).  \n4. **Revving engine** (increasing pitch as the car approaches).  \n\nFor a simple simulation, you could:  \n- Use a free audio editor (e.g., Audacity) to layer these sounds.  \n- Search for \"car passing sound effect\" on platforms like [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) or YouTube.  \n- Adjust volume and timing to create a realistic \"whoosh\" effect.  \n\nIf creating from scratch, start with a low rumble, add a sharp screech, and overlay wind noise for depth. \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8", "**Sound Effect: \"Car Passing By\"**  \n*Description:*  \nStart with a low, rumbling engine growl (deep, resonant bass tones). This transitions into a series of sharp, rhythmic *thudding* sounds (representing tire contact with pavement). As the car approaches, add a high-pitched *whoosh* of wind and a faint *hiss* of tire friction. Midway, introduce a brief, piercing *honk* of the horn. As the car passes, the engine noise fades into a distant, echoing *rumble* and a fading *whoosh* of wind. End with a subtle *crackle* of static to simulate fading distance.  \n\n*How to Create:*  \n1. Layer a low-frequency engine sound (e.g., a sine wave with a gradual rise in pitch).  \n2. Add short, staccato \"thud\" samples for tires.  \n3. Use a high-frequency \"whoosh\" and \"hiss\" for wind and friction.  \n4. Include a sharp \"honk\" at the peak.  \n5.

The fear of \"not being good enough\" or \"failing\" looms over every decision.  \n   - Deadlines for proposals, data collection, and writing are often arbitrary and unrealistic, leading to burnout.  \n\n2. **Financial Instability**:  \n   - Many graduate students work part-time or take on debt, sacrificing time for research and personal life. The financial strain can lead to anxiety about the future.  \n\n3. **Isolation and Lack of Support**:  \n   - Graduate programs often prioritize independence over mentorship. Without clear guidance, students may feel lost, especially when facing setbacks like failed experiments or rejected papers.  \n   - The \"hustle culture\" of academia can make it hard to ask for help, fostering a toxic environment of overwork.  \n\n4. **Existential Uncertainty**:  \n   - The path to a PhD or master\u2019s degree is rarely clear. Questions like \"Will this lead to a job?\" or \"Is this worth it?\" haunt students, especially in fields with limited job markets.  \n\n5. **Mental Health Struggles**:  \n   - Chronic stress, imposter syndrome, and the fear of failure can lead to anxiety, depression, or burnout.
