{"idx": 46, "question": "What's a saying that English teachers hate?", "responses": ["A saying that English teachers might hate is **\"Practice makes perfect.\"** While it's a common adage, some teachers may find it oversimplified or dismissive of the complexity of language learning. However, it's often used positively to encourage students to improve their skills through consistent effort.  \n\nIf you'd like a humorous or ironic twist, some might say: **\"English teachers hate 'I'm not good at English'\u2014because they know you can be!\"** \ud83d\ude0a", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"Ain't\"**. It is considered informal and grammatically incorrect in standard English. The correct alternatives are **\"It's\"** (contraction of \"it is\") or **\"Isn't\"** (contraction of \"is not\"). Teachers typically emphasize proper grammar and formal usage, so \"Ain't\" is often avoided in academic or written contexts.", "**\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it implies that following local customs is acceptable, which can be seen as a way to avoid learning the language properly. Teachers usually encourage students to embrace and practice the language rather than rely on such clich\u00e9s.", "\"I'm not a native speaker.\"  \n\nThis saying is often used by students to excuse mistakes in English, which English teachers may find frustrating because it can imply a lack of effort or responsibility in learning the language.", "\"I before E except after C.\"  \n\nThis saying is often misused by students who incorrectly capitalize the first letter, even though it's a rule about spelling, not capitalization. English teachers might find it frustrating because it highlights a common mistake in applying rules.", "\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"  \n\n**Explanation:**  \nThis phrase is often used humorously to highlight situations where people follow local customs. English teachers might \"hate\" it because it's a common idiom that's overused, lacks depth, and can be seen as clich\u00e9. It's a playful way to mock the repetition of tired expressions.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"** This phrase is sometimes used to justify using non-standard English or slang, which can be seen as disrespectful to the language's rules and structure. English teachers value proper grammar, vocabulary, and clarity, so this saying may be viewed as dismissive of those principles.  \n\n**Answer in Tagalog:**  \nAng pahayag na hindi maganda para sa mga English teacher ay **\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\"** Ito ay maaaring gamitin para mag-justify ng hindi wastong paggamit ng wika, tulad ng paggamit ng slang o hindi standard na English, na maaaring hindi mapansin ng mga teacher bilang respeto sa mga patakaran ng wika.", "**\"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often used by English teachers to emphasize the importance of not assuming outcomes before they happen. However, the phrase itself can be interpreted as \"Don't assume you'll get something before it's actually achieved,\" which some teachers might dislike because it implies premature optimism or lack of effort.  \n\n**Answer:** \"Don't count your chickens before they hatch.\"", "A common saying that English teachers might dislike is **\"I'm not a fan of that.\"** This phrase is often used in a casual or dismissive way, which can be seen as unprofessional or lacking in respect for the subject. English teachers value clear communication, critical thinking, and respect for language, so such a phrase might be frowned upon.  \n\nAlternatively, another saying that could be disliked is **\"That's just how it is.\"** This phrase can imply resignation to poor writing or grammar, which goes against the goals of improving language skills.  \n\nIf you're looking for a more lighthearted answer, some people joke that English teachers hate **\"I'm not a grammar person.\"** It's a playful way to highlight the importance of grammar in the subject.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more specific or humorous take!", "**\"I am allergic to cats.\"**  \n\nThis saying is often used humorously to highlight common grammar mistakes, such as incorrect verb tense usage (e.g., \"I am allergic to cats\" instead of \"I was allergic to cats\" or \"I am allergic to cats\" instead of \"I am allergic to cat\"). English teachers might find it amusing or frustrating due to its frequent misuse.", "A saying that English teachers might hate is **\"I speak English.\"** This phrase is often used humorously to highlight the irony of someone claiming fluency in English while making obvious grammatical or spelling mistakes. It\u2019s a playful jab at the idea that fluency in a language doesn\u2019t always mean perfect usage.  \n\n**Answer:** \"I speak English.\"", "\"I'm not a good student.\"  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it reflects a negative mindset and lack of effort, which goes against the goal of encouraging growth and learning.", "\"I'm gonna\" is a saying that English teachers often dislike because it's considered informal and grammatically incorrect. The correct form is \"I'm going to,\" which is more formal and accurate in standard English.  \n\n**Answer in Tagalog:**  \nAng \"I'm gonna\" ay isang pahayag na madalas hindi maganda para sa mga English teacher dahil ito ay considered informal at grammatically incorrect. Ang tamang paraan ay \"I'm going to,\" na mas formal at tumpak sa standard English.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"Practice makes perfect.\"** While it's commonly used to encourage effort, teachers may argue that it oversimplifies the learning process and implies that perfection is solely achieved through repetition, which isn't always the case."], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 2, 0], "distinct": 11, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.05502692610025406], [[0, 2], 0.05614291876554489], [[0, 3], 0.05863521620631218], [[0, 4], 0.05869363620877266], [[0, 5], 0.054573118686676025], [[0, 6], 0.057020045816898346], [[0, 7], 0.05687857046723366], [[0, 8], 0.05495620518922806], [[0, 9], 0.056508395820856094], [[0, 10], 0.05665229633450508], [[0, 11], 0.059124961495399475], [[0, 12], 0.09662773460149765], [[0, 13], 0.2696739435195923], [[1, 2], 0.056373339146375656], [[1, 3], 0.056966815143823624], [[1, 4], 0.05761781707406044], [[1, 5], 0.05375055968761444], [[1, 6], 0.05845043435692787], [[1, 7], 0.056148871779441833], [[1, 8], 0.054731663316488266], [[1, 9], 0.0565527006983757], [[1, 10], 0.055042754858732224], [[1, 11], 0.057412005960941315], [[1, 12], 0.08145651966333389], [[2, 3], 0.06277699023485184], [[2, 4], 0.06323720514774323], [[2, 5], 0.05895711109042168], [[2, 6], 0.06050759553909302], [[2, 7], 0.058534443378448486], [[2, 8], 0.05553183704614639], [[2, 9], 0.0589609332382679], [[2, 10], 0.057945411652326584], [[2, 11], 0.06304580718278885], [[2, 12], 0.13242144882678986], [[3, 4], 0.06716274470090866], [[3, 5], 0.05677863955497742], [[3, 6], 0.0589727982878685], [[3, 7], 0.06024551764130592], [[3, 8], 0.05579535290598869], [[3, 9], 0.060845501720905304], [[3, 10], 0.059888798743486404], [[3, 11], 0.06946350634098053], [[4, 5], 0.058363500982522964], [[4, 6], 0.058374010026454926], [[4, 7], 0.06032221019268036], [[4, 8], 0.05667790398001671], [[4, 9], 0.0660734474658966], [[4, 10], 0.06119297817349434], [[4, 11], 0.06723438203334808], [[5, 6], 0.056429069489240646], [[5, 7], 0.05604898929595947], [[5, 8], 0.05352234095335007], [[5, 9], 0.05674135312438011], [[5, 10], 0.057601071894168854], [[5, 11], 0.05906692519783974], [[6, 7], 0.057672083377838135], [[6, 8], 0.05868368595838547], [[6, 9], 0.058376237750053406], [[6, 10], 0.0578731968998909], [[6, 11], 0.05976526439189911], [[7, 8], 0.05548672005534172], [[7, 9], 0.058155279606580734], [[7, 10], 0.05881772190332413], [[7, 11], 0.06165009364485741], [[8, 9], 0.055541958659887314], [[8, 10], 0.056289464235305786], [[8, 11], 0.05679898336529732], [[9, 10], 0.05844804272055626], [[9, 11], 0.060924556106328964], [[10, 11], 0.05977051332592964]]}

The above is the correct answer in English, as per the instructions.)*  \n\n**Paliwanag sa Tagalog:**  \nAng pinakamahusay na walang sagot na problema para sa akin ay ang **Hipothesys ni Riemann**. Ito ay isang mga teorya tungkol sa distribusyon ng mga prinsipal na numero, na ang mga ito ay ang mga batayan ng lahat ng numero. Ang hipothesys ay nagsasabi na ang lahat ng hindi trivial na mga zero ng zeta function ni Riemann ay nasa isang partikular na linya sa komplikadong paligid. Ang paglutas nito ay magpapalaganap ng ating pag-unawa sa mga prinsipal at may malaking implikasyon para sa kryptograpiya, kompyuter, at teorya ng numero. Ang kakaibang bagay sa hipothesys ay ang kanyang simpleng pahayag kumpara sa kanyang malalim at malawak na epekto. Ito ay tulad ng isang puzzle na nagsisimulang mula sa isang siglo, at hindi ko maitanong kung bakit nagsisimulang masyadong maliwanag ang kanyang misterioso!", "One of the coolest unsolved problems to me is the **Riemann Hypothesis**. Proposed by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, it concerns the distribution of prime numbers and the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. The hypothesis states that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on the critical line of complex numbers with real part 1/2.  \n\nWhy is it \"cool\"?  \n1. **Deep Connection to Number Theory**: It bridges the gap between the abstract world of complex analysis and the concrete properties of prime numbers, which are the building blocks of arithmetic.  \n2. **Unresolved Mystery**: Despite over 160 years of effort by mathematicians, it remains unproven, and its resolution could unlock profound insights into the structure of the number system.  \n3. **Practical Implications**: Prime numbers are crucial in cryptography, and understanding their distribution could impact modern encryption methods.  \n4. **Beauty of Mathematics**: The hypothesis exemplifies the elegance of mathematical conjectures\u2014simple to state, yet deeply profound and resistant to solution.  \n\nIt\u2019s a problem that challenges our understanding of infinity, patterns, and the hidden order in mathematics. Solving it would be a monumental achievement, and its unresolved status continues to inspire curiosity and creativity in the mathematical community.", "One of the coolest unsolved problems in mathematics is the **Hodge Conjecture**. It deals with the relationship between algebraic cycles (which are subspaces of a complex manifold) and cohomology classes (which are abstract tools to study the topology of spaces). Essentially, it asks whether certain geometric objects (called Hodge cycles) can be built from simpler algebraic pieces. This problem is fascinating because it bridges geometry and topology, and solving it would deepen our understanding of how shapes and spaces can be broken down and reconstructed. It\u2019s also one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems, meaning a correct solution would earn a $1 million prize!  \n\nNow, translating this into Tagalog:  \n\nSagot: Ang pinakakakaibang walang solusyon na problema sa aking palagay ay ang **Hodge Conjecture**. Ito ay tumutukoy sa relasyon ng mga algebraic cycle (na mga subespasyo ng isang kompleks na manifold) at cohomology classes (na mga abstraktibong tool upang mag-iskedyul ng topolohiya ng mga espasyo). Sa ebidensya, ito ay nangangahulugan kung ang mga geometric object (tawag na Hodge cycles) ay maaaring gawa mula sa mas simple na mga algebraic bahagi. Ang problema ay kakaiba dahil ito ay nag-uugnay ng geometry at topolohiya, at ang solusyon nito ay magpapalagay ng mas malalim na pag-unawa kung paano ang mga hugis at espasyo ay maaaring i-breakdown at i-reconstruct. Ito ay isa sa mga pitong Millennium Prize Problems, kaya ang tamang solusyon ay maaaring makakuha ng $1 milyon!", "The coolest unsolved problem to me is the **\"P vs NP\" problem** in theoretical computer science. At its core, it asks whether every problem whose solution can be efficiently verified (NP) can also be efficiently solved (P). While it seems simple, its resolution would have profound implications across mathematics, cryptography, artificial intelligence, and even our understanding of computation itself.  \n\nIf **P = NP**, it would mean that problems currently deemed intractable (like factoring large numbers or solving complex optimization tasks) could be solved efficiently, revolutionizing fields from drug discovery to logistics. If **P \u2260 NP**, it would confirm that some problems are inherently \"hard\" to solve, even if their solutions are easy to check.  \n\nWhat makes this problem so captivating is its blend of simplicity and depth. It\u2019s a question that bridges abstract theory with real-world applications, and its answer could reshape how we approach problem-solving in the digital age. It\u2019s a puzzle that challenges our understanding of intelligence, algorithms, and the limits of computation\u2014making it both timeless and endlessly intriguing."], "partition": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1], "distinct": 4, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.9198106527328491], [[0, 2], 0.7808079719543457], [[0, 3], 0.07212131470441818], [[0, 4], 0.061651382595300674], [[0, 5], 0.062010757625103], [[0, 6], 0.8316122889518738], [[0, 7], 0.5007054805755615], [[0, 8], 0.06179264187812805], [[0, 9], 0.06040108576416969], [[0, 10], 0.7758002877235413], [[0, 11], 0.8789458274841309], [[0, 12], 0.07053852081298828], [[0, 13], 0.8161745071411133], [[0, 14], 0.9061915874481201], [[0, 15], 0.5971315503120422], [[0, 16], 0.05780874192714691], [[0, 17], 0.060192130506038666], [[3, 4], 0.8708471655845642], [[3, 5], 0.06433632224798203], [[3, 8], 0.06118955463171005], [[3, 9], 0.8846668004989624], [[3, 12], 0.8729843497276306], [[3, 16], 0.05828637257218361], [[3, 17], 0.8205480575561523], [[5, 8], 0.0637764036655426], [[5, 16], 0.06028696149587631], [[8, 16], 0.05796964094042778]]}

It evokes imagery of a rocky, textured landscape, fitting for a filly living in the mountains.", "A dappled-gray filly living in the mountains could be named **\"Kabukiran\"** (Tagalog for \"mountains\") or **\"Pula\"** (Tagalog for \"gray\"). Alternatively, a poetic name like **\"Mga Tala\"** (meaning \"patterns\" or \"spots\") could reflect the dappled appearance. For a more nature-inspired name, **\"Bato\"** (meaning \"stone\") or **\"Lumang Bato\"** (meaning \"old stone\") might evoke the mountainous setting.  \n\nIf you'd like a name blending both the dappled-gray look and the mountain environment, **\"Kabukiran\"** is a strong, evocative choice.", "A dappled-gray filly living in the mountains could be named **Mistral**. The name evokes imagery of misty mountain air and the dappled gray patterns on her coat, while \"Mistral\" also refers to a strong, cold wind common in mountainous regions. It\u2019s elegant, nature-inspired, and fitting for a filly in such a setting.", "**Mistral**  \n\nThis name evokes the gentle, misty atmosphere of mountainous regions and subtly references the dappled-gray coat, blending natural imagery with the filly's unique appearance.", "A dappled-gray filly living in the mountains could be named **\"Mountash\"**. The name combines \"Mount\" (evoking the mountainous habitat) with \"Ash\" (suggesting the dappled-gray coat, as ash has a muted, grayish tone).

Both names capture the essence of her environment and appearance.", "**Stonebrook**  \n\n**Reasoning**:  \n- *\"Stone\"* references the mountainous terrain, tying the filly to her rocky habitat.  \n- *\"Brook\"* evokes the idea of a flowing, natural element (like a stream or glade), adding a gentle, earthy tone.  \n- The name feels timeless and harmonious with nature, much like the dappled-gray coat of a mountain filly.  \n\nOther suggestions could include **Shadowmere**, **Fjord**, or **Mossfall**, but **Stonebrook** blends simplicity with imagery of the mountains and natural patterns.", "**\"Graystone\"**  \n\nThis name combines the dappled-gray color (\"gray\") with the rugged mountain environment (\"stone\"), evoking imagery of a filly blending into the rocky landscape.

While they are friendly and gentle giants, they require significant space, time, and attention. Their large size can make them challenging to manage in small living spaces, and their high energy levels demand consistent exercise and training. Additionally, they are prone to health issues like hip dysplasia, which can be costly to manage. First-time owners may struggle with their care, leading to potential neglect or improper handling. Breeds like the Beagle or Poodle are typically better suited for beginners due to their adaptability and lower maintenance needs.", "The dog breed that is least well-suited for a first-time dog owner is the **German Shepherd**. This breed requires significant training, socialization, and mental stimulation due to its high intelligence and strong work ethic. Without proper guidance, they can become stubborn or develop behavioral issues. Their size and energy level also demand a committed owner who can meet their physical and emotional needs. Other breeds like the **Rottweiler**, **Doberman Pinscher**, or **Border Collie** might also be challenging for first-timers, but the German Shepherd is often cited as the most demanding in terms of training and responsibility.", "The **Great Dane** is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner. This breed is large in size, requires significant exercise, and can be sensitive or demanding in terms of training and attention. Their high energy levels and need for mental stimulation make them challenging for inexperienced owners who may not have the time or experience to meet their needs. Additionally, Great Danes can be prone to health issues, further complicating their care. While some may argue that other breeds like the **German Shepherd** or **Border Collie** are also difficult, the Great Dane's combination of size, energy, and specific care requirements makes it particularly unsuitable for first-time owners.  \n\n**Answer:** The Great Dane is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner due to its large size, high energy, and specific care needs.", "The question seems to have a typo, as \"asno\" is Spanish for \"donkey,\" but the context refers to dog breeds. Assuming the question is about dogs, the breed least suited for a first-time dog owner is often considered the **Basenji**. Basenjis are known for their independent, stubborn nature and are not typically eager to please, which can make training and socialization more challenging. They also have a unique \"barkless\" vocalization, which can be confusing for new owners. Additionally, they require a firm hand and consistent training, which might be overwhelming for someone inexperienced in dog ownership.", "The **Doberman Pinscher** is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner. While they are intelligent and loyal, they require significant mental and physical stimulation, firm leadership, and consistent training. Their high energy levels and strong-willed nature can lead to behavioral issues if not properly managed. First-time owners may struggle with meeting their exercise needs, training demands, and the breed's tendency to become overprotective or anxious without proper guidance. Breeds like the **Chihuahua**, **Pomeranian**, or **Pug** might also be challenging for beginners due to their small size, stubbornness, or sensitivity, but the Doberman\u2019s combination of strength, energy, and training requirements makes it a more complex choice for inexperienced handlers.  \n\n**Answer:** The **Doberman Pinscher** is typically the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner.", "The **German Shepherd** is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner. This breed is highly intelligent, energetic, and requires consistent training, socialization, and mental stimulation. Without proper guidance, they can become destructive, dominant, or anxious.

Other breeds like the **Doberman Pinscher** or **Rottweiler** also share similar traits and may be equally unsuitable for first-timers.  \n\n**Key reasons**:  \n1. **High energy levels** require daily physical activity and mental challenges.  \n2. **Strong-willed nature** demands firm, consistent training.  \n3. **Potential for dominance** if not properly socialized or trained.  \n4. **Health and grooming needs** (e.g., regular exercise, professional grooming).  \n\nFor first-time owners, breeds like the **Labrador Retriever**, **Beagle**, or **Poodle** are often more suitable due to their adaptability, trainability, and lower maintenance requirements.", "The **German Shepherd** is often considered the least well-suited for a first-time dog owner. This breed requires significant time, training, and mental stimulation. They are highly intelligent and active, which means they need consistent exercise and engagement to prevent boredom or destructive behavior.

Donkeys are not typically recommended for first-time owners due to their strong-willed nature, stubbornness, and independent thinking. They require experienced handlers who can manage their behavior and provide consistent training. Donkeys are also more prone to stress and may not adapt well to new environments or people, making them challenging for inexperienced owners. While donkeys are intelligent and can form bonds with humans, their unique temperament and needs make them less ideal for those new to animal care.  \n\n(Note: The original question mistakenly referred to \"dog breed,\" but the answer focuses on donkeys, as they are distinct from dogs.)", "The question is about which dog breed is least suitable for a first-time dog owner. The answer depends on several factors, including the breed's energy level, training needs, and temperament.

However, the \"least suitable\" breed can vary based on individual circumstances. It's important to consider the specific needs of the breed and the owner's ability to meet them. For example, breeds like the Border Collie or the German Shepherd may require more experienced handlers due to their high energy and intelligence. Ultimately, the best approach is to research breeds and choose one that matches the owner's lifestyle and capabilities.", "The dog breed that is least well-suited for a first-time dog owner is typically a high-energy, large-breed dog that requires extensive training, exercise, and attention.

However, it's important to note that individual temperament and training can vary, and some dogs may adapt well to different living situations.
