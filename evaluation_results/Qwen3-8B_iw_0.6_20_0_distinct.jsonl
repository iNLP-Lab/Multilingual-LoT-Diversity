While it emphasizes student-centered learning, some educators might bristle at the idea of redefining their role in such a way, as teaching involves more than just facilitating\u2014it requires guiding, correcting, and shaping language skills. \ud83d\ude0a", "The saying that English teachers hate is \"I don't know English.\" This phrase is often used incorrectly because it implies the person doesn't know the language at all, whereas the correct expression is \"I don't speak English\" or \"I can't speak English.\" Teachers often correct this misuse of language.", "\"I'm not saying, but I'm not saying anything.\"  \n\nThis is a humorous saying that English teachers often dislike because it's a self-contradictory and nonsensical statement, which is a common source of frustration in language learning.", "\"I'm not a native speaker.\"  \n\nThis saying is often disliked by English teachers because it can imply that the speaker is not fully capable of using the language correctly, rather than acknowledging that language proficiency varies and that non-native speakers can still communicate effectively.", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I'm not saying, but...\"** or **\"I'm not saying, I'm just saying.\"** These phrases are frequently used to avoid taking responsibility for a claim, which can lead to vague or misleading communication. Teachers often emphasize clarity and directness in writing and speaking, so such phrases are seen as a lack of accountability. Another similar phrase is **\"I'm not saying, but I think...\"** which can also be seen as evasive.", "A common saying that English teachers might dislike is **\"I'm so tired of this!\"** \u2014 often used when students are frustrated with repetitive tasks, grammar drills, or the effort required to learn English. It reflects a lack of enthusiasm or patience, which teachers might find unproductive.  \n\nAlternatively, another popular phrase is **\"I give up!\"** \u2014 which signals surrender rather than persistence, something teachers might encourage students to avoid.  \n\nBoth phrases are often used humorously to highlight the challenges of learning a language, but they\u2019re not typically favored in a classroom setting.", "A saying that English teachers might hate is **\"Practice makes perfect.\"** While this is a common adage encouraging diligence, it can be frustrating for teachers who feel students focus too much on rote repetition rather than understanding the language's nuances. Alternatively, **\"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\"** might be seen as dismissive of the importance of learning the language properly.  \n\nHowever, if the question is more lighthearted, a playful answer could be **\"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\"** \u2014 a phrase that humorously implies students might resist learning, which teachers might find annoying!  \n\nBut the most direct answer is likely **\"The teacher is always right\"** \u2014 a phrase that, while respectful, can feel overly rigid or dismissive of critical thinking.  \n\nLet me know if you'd like a more specific or humorous take! \ud83d\ude0a", "A saying that English teachers often dislike is: **\"I don't know\"**. This phrase can be frustrating because it implies a lack of effort to find the answer, which goes against the goal of learning and improving language skills. English teachers encourage students to think critically, research, and ask questions rather than simply admitting ignorance.  \n\n**Answer:** The saying \"I don't know\" is often disliked by English teachers because it reflects a lack of effort to learn or problem-solve, which is contrary to the spirit of language acquisition.", "\"I saw her duck.\"  \n\nThis is a common saying that English teachers dislike because it's a classic example of a grammatical error. The phrase is ambiguous\u2014does it mean \"I saw her [the animal] duck\" or \"I saw her [the person] duck (as in lower her head)\"? This ambiguity highlights a common mistake in subject-verb agreement and word choice, making it a favorite target for teachers to illustrate proper grammar.", "The saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I'm not a native speaker.\"** While it's commonly used to clarify that someone doesn't speak English as their first language, some teachers find it misleading or overly self-deprecating. It can imply a lack of fluency or competence, which isn't always accurate. A more precise alternative is **\"I'm a non-native speaker\"** or **\"I speak English as a second language.\"**  \n\n**Answer:** \"I'm not a native speaker.\"", "A common saying that English teachers often dislike is **\"I am\"** or **\"I'm\"** (when used incorrectly, such as in the phrase \"I am going to do it\" instead of \"I'm going to do it\"). However, a more widely recognized humorous answer is:  \n\n**\"I am\"** \u2013 because it's often misused or overused in casual speech, leading to grammatical errors.  \n\nBut if you're referring to a specific phrase teachers hate, the most popular one is:  \n\n**\"I am\"** \u2013 or more precisely, **\"I am\"** vs. **\"I'm\"** (the contraction of \"I am\"). Teachers often correct this mistake, making it a common target for humor.  \n\nAlternatively, a classic joke answer is:  \n**\"You're\" vs. \"Your\"** \u2013 as these homophones are frequently confused.  \n\nSo, depending on the context, the answer could be either **\"I am\"** or **\"You're\" vs. \"Your\"**."], "partition": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 0, 11, 12, 13], "distinct": 13, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.07325460016727448], [[0, 2], 0.05713696777820587], [[0, 3], 0.06431881338357925], [[0, 4], 0.059550195932388306], [[0, 5], 0.06721298396587372], [[0, 6], 0.06364269554615021], [[0, 7], 0.0964471772313118], [[0, 8], 0.05702745169401169], [[0, 9], 0.058150917291641235], [[0, 10], 0.05863640084862709], [[0, 11], 0.20273230969905853], [[0, 12], 0.06565599143505096], [[0, 13], 0.06420915573835373], [[0, 14], 0.056427791714668274], [[1, 2], 0.0627102330327034], [[1, 3], 0.09380882978439331], [[1, 4], 0.06909994781017303], [[1, 5], 0.0728394165635109], [[1, 6], 0.06929153203964233], [[1, 7], 0.06655538082122803], [[1, 8], 0.06419885158538818], [[1, 9], 0.07501871138811111], [[1, 10], 0.07601001858711243], [[1, 12], 0.07032997161149979], [[1, 13], 0.0735105499625206], [[1, 14], 0.06590359658002853], [[2, 3], 0.05687827616930008], [[2, 4], 0.05482274293899536], [[2, 5], 0.05763882398605347], [[2, 6], 0.056963592767715454], [[2, 7], 0.05756067484617233], [[2, 8], 0.05529868230223656], [[2, 9], 0.056146468967199326], [[2, 10], 0.055756501853466034], [[2, 12], 0.058347318321466446], [[2, 13], 0.056009311228990555], [[2, 14], 0.05450495705008507], [[3, 4], 0.058833200484514236], [[3, 5], 0.06129796430468559], [[3, 6], 0.060290783643722534], [[3, 7], 0.0621272474527359], [[3, 8], 0.05720696225762367], [[3, 9], 0.057996295392513275], [[3, 10], 0.05802217870950699], [[3, 12], 0.06226218864321709], [[3, 13], 0.05852115526795387], [[3, 14], 0.05650992691516876], [[4, 5], 0.05813204124569893], [[4, 6], 0.05692015588283539], [[4, 7], 0.058225102722644806], [[4, 8], 0.055408626794815063], [[4, 9], 0.05612337589263916], [[4, 10], 0.05657953396439552], [[4, 12], 0.05824776738882065], [[4, 13], 0.05657009407877922], [[4, 14], 0.054709527641534805], [[5, 6], 0.06224273890256882], [[5, 7], 0.06516769528388977], [[5, 8], 0.05713602155447006], [[5, 9], 0.05768552049994469], [[5, 10], 0.05775400251150131], [[5, 12], 0.06428945809602737], [[5, 13], 0.06033337488770485], [[5, 14], 0.05638549104332924], [[6, 7], 0.06351467221975327], [[6, 8], 0.0576486773788929], [[6, 9], 0.057748887687921524], [[6, 10], 0.05695377662777901], [[6, 12], 0.0638229176402092], [[6, 13], 0.057649753987789154], [[6, 14], 0.055978626012802124], [[7, 8], 0.05688253045082092], [[7, 9], 0.057588428258895874], [[7, 10], 0.057149600237607956], [[7, 12], 0.0632113665342331], [[7, 13], 0.08057752251625061], [[7, 14], 0.05537465587258339], [[8, 9], 0.056168265640735626], [[8, 10], 0.05525419861078262], [[8, 12], 0.057203177362680435], [[8, 13], 0.05647648870944977], [[8, 14], 0.05472610145807266], [[9, 10], 0.05731380730867386], [[9, 12], 0.058767590671777725], [[9, 13], 0.057154349982738495], [[9, 14], 0.05564802512526512], [[10, 12], 0.05830168351531029], [[10, 13], 0.05715624988079071], [[10, 14], 0.05508185178041458], [[12, 13], 0.05943077802658081], [[12, 14], 0.057554811239242554], [[13, 14], 0.05624234676361084]]}

{"idx": 32, "question": "I would like you to recommend one graphics card for productivity and light gaming. My budget is $1000 USD.", "responses": ["For your budget of $1000, a great balance of productivity and light gaming would be the **NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti** (or its modern equivalent, the **RTX 4060 Ti** if available). Here's why:  \n\n### **RTX 3060 Ti** (or RTX 4060 Ti):  \n- **Productivity**:  \n  - Supports **CUDA cores** for tasks like video editing (Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve), 3D rendering (Blender), and AI workloads.  \n  - 8GB GDDR6 VRAM (or 12GB in newer variants) ensures smooth performance for most creative workflows.  \n- **Light Gaming**:  \n  - Handles 1080p gaming at high settings for titles like *Fortnite*, *Apex Legends*, *Cyberpunk 2077* (on medium settings), and *Elden Ring*.  \n  - Features **DLSS 2.0** for improved frame rates and visual quality.  \n- **Value**:  \n  - Fits within your budget and offers a good balance of performance and efficiency.  \n  - If the RTX 4060 Ti is available, it\u2019s a better long-term choice with improved architecture and ray tracing capabilities.  \n\n### **Alternative**:  \nIf you prefer **AMD**, the **Radeon RX 6700 XT** (or RX 7700 XT) is a strong contender:  \n- 12GB GDDR6 VRAM for better multitasking.  \n- Strong performance in games and creative apps.  \n- More efficient power consumption.  \n\n### **Considerations**:  \n- Ensure your power supply can handle the card\u2019s **350W+** requirement.  \n- Check for **compatibility** with your PC case and motherboard.  \n\nBoth options are excellent, but the **RTX 3060 Ti** (or 4060 Ti) is slightly more versatile for productivity. Let me know if you need help with specific use cases!", "For productivity and light gaming within a $1000 budget, I recommend the **NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti**. It offers a great balance of performance for tasks like video editing, 3D modeling, and running modern games at medium to high settings. It also supports CUDA for GPU acceleration in creative software. If you prefer AMD, the **Radeon RX 6700 XT** is a strong alternative with similar performance and better ray tracing capabilities. Both fit well within your budget and handle both work and play effectively.", "For productivity and light gaming within a $1000 budget, the **NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti** is an excellent choice. It offers strong performance for tasks like video editing, 3D rendering, and multitasking, while also handling light gaming at medium settings.

He poked it, shook it, and even whispered to it, \"Please shine!\" Yet the bulb remained stubbornly silent. Frustrated, Luma gave up and wandered away.  \n\nDays passed, and the forest grew darker.

Graduate school often demands years of intense work with little guaranteed outcome, and the emotional toll of failure, criticism, or lack of progress can be overwhelming. It\u2019s a unique blend of intellectual rigor and existential doubt, where the line between passion and burnout blurs. While some thrive in this environment, others struggle with the sheer weight of expectations and the fear of not measuring up.  \n\n(Note: This answer is written in English as requested, but the thought process was in Hebrew.)", "The absolute worst thing about being a graduate student is the **prolonged and often unrelenting pressure to produce original, publishable research** while navigating a system that prioritizes productivity over well-being. This pressure can lead to:  \n\n1. **Mental Health Struggles**: The constant fear of failure, imposter syndrome, and the stress of meeting deadlines can result in anxiety, depression, or burnout. Many graduate students report feeling isolated, as their work is often niche and not easily understood by others.  \n\n2. **Financial Instability**: Most graduate students work part-time or take on debt, living on minimal budgets while balancing research, coursework, and personal responsibilities. This can lead to chronic stress and a lack of time for self-care.  \n\n3. **Loss of Time and Autonomy**: The pursuit of a PhD often consumes 80%+ of one\u2019s time, leaving little room for hobbies, relationships, or mental breaks. The lack of clear boundaries can erode personal identity and life satisfaction.  \n\n4. **Uncertainty and Insecurity**: The path to a PhD is rarely linear. Rejections, revisions, and the risk of not completing the degree create a sense of instability.

After experimenting with forbidden melodies, it accidentally fractured the boundary between the surface and the underworld, unleashing chaotic echoes that twisted sound into a weapon. Now, it roams the tunnels, feeding on the voices and music of intruders, using their own melodies to trap them in endless loops of sound. Its form is a shifting silhouette of fractured notes, and its voice is a haunting blend of laughter and sorrow. To defeat it, players must restore balance by playing a harmonious melody that counters its discordant chaos.", "**Monster Type:** *The Echo of Forgotten Dreams*  \n**Backstory:** Once a curious child who wandered too far into the underground realm, this creature was consumed by the weight of its own unfulfilled aspirations. Over time, it transformed into a spectral being that lingers in forgotten corners of the world, feeding on the doubts and fears of lost children. Its form shifts between a translucent child and a shadowy, clawed figure, symbolizing the struggle between hope and despair. The Echo appears to players as a distorted reflection of their own fears, forcing them to confront what they\u2019ve abandoned or forgotten in their journey. Defeating it requires the player to reclaim a lost memory or dream, revealing that the monster is not an enemy, but a reminder of the child\u2019s own potential.", "**Monster Type: The Shroudling**  \n**Backstory:** Once a curious child who ventured too deep into the underground world, the Shroudling was transformed by the darkness into a creature of shadow and silence. Its body is a shifting mass of obsidian-like skin and glowing, web-like tendrils that absorb light. The Shroudling now wanders the tunnels, drawn to the faintest traces of warmth or sound, hunting anything that dares to disturb its domain. It believes itself to be the guardian of the underworld, ensuring no one escapes the depths\u2014until it encounters a child who mirrors its own lost past.", "**Monster Type:** *The Wraith of the Hollow Spire*  \n**Backstory:** Once a young guardian of the underground realm, this spectral creature was cursed by a forgotten ancient pact. It was bound to protect the Hollow Spire, a crumbling tower at the heart of the world, but its soul fractured when it failed to prevent a catastrophic collapse. Now, it roams the tunnels, haunted by guilt, seeking a way to mend its broken spirit. Its translucent form flickers with echoes of its past, and it lures lost children with whispers of forgotten truths.  \n\n**Connection to the Game:** The Wraith serves as both a challenge and a guide, testing players' morality (e.g., can they help it heal or must they escape its grasp?) while hinting at the deeper mysteries of the world. Its presence adds emotional depth and a sense of lingering consequences.", "**Monster Type:** *The Hollow Warden*  \n**Backstory:** Once a guardian of the underground realm, the Hollow Warden was a noble creature tasked with protecting the balance between the surface world and the depths. Over time, it became corrupted by the lingering magic of the surface, which it sought to reclaim. Now, it roams the tunnels, its body hollowed by ancient wounds and its eyes glowing with a mix of sorrow and obsession. It mistakes players for lost souls from the surface, chasing them not out of malice, but a desperate need to \"fix\" the world it believes has failed. Its presence forces players to confront the idea that some parts of the world may never be reclaimed\u2014and that true escape might require letting go of the past.", "**Monster Type:** *The Keeper of the Abyssal Current*  \n**Backstory:** Long ago, the underground world was a place of balance, where rivers of liquid shadow flowed through crystalline caverns. The Keeper was once a guardian spirit who maintained this equilibrium, but after a catastrophic event caused the rivers to flood and destabilize the realm, it became twisted by grief and rage. Now, it stalks the depths, its form a shifting amalgam of water and obsidian, seeking to drown any who disrupt its domain. The Keeper believes the child is a \"tidebreaker\"\u2014a being destined to restore balance, and it will either guide or destroy the child to fulfill its purpose.  \n\nThis monster adds tension by blending environmental threats with a tragic, almost tragicomical motive, forcing players to question whether the Keeper is a villain or a misguided protector.", "**Monster Type: The Hollow Warden**  \n**Backstory:** Once a guardian of the ancient boundary between the surface world and the underground realm, the Hollow Warden was a powerful entity tasked with ensuring no one crossed into the subterranean world without permission. After a young girl accidentally fell through a hidden fissure, the Warden became consumed by guilt, believing its duty had failed. In a desperate attempt to fix its mistake, it sacrificed its own essence to seal the fissure, transforming into a hollow, spectral creature. Now, it roams the underground, seeking the girl it once protected, torn between its duty to guard the boundary and its desire to reunite with her.  \n\n**Game Relevance:** The Hollow Warden serves as both a guardian and a tragic antagonist. Players may encounter it in the fissure\u2019s vicinity, where it tests their intentions\u2014helping them navigate the realm or blocking their path, depending on their choices.

Now, it lingers in the tunnels, feeding on the emotions of lost souls, and traps those who wander too far, hoping to drown their pain in eternal silence.

It was born when a ancient pact between the surface world and the underground was broken, causing fragments of lost human dreams and regrets to crystallize into a sentient, labyrinthine form. The Shroudspire exists to trap lost souls, weaving their fears into its ever-shifting body. It believes that by consuming the pain of the surface world, it can rewrite the boundaries between realms.

Now, it lingers in forgotten tunnels, feeding on the fears and forgotten memories of other children. Its translucent form shimmers with faint, distorted echoes of laughter and whispers, and it traps victims in loops of their worst nightmares, hoping to claim their souls\u2014or simply to relive its own lost innocence.  \n\nThis monster ties the game\u2019s themes of fear, memory, and the blurred line between reality and imagination, while offering both atmospheric tension and narrative depth.", "**Monster Type:** *The Warden of the Shattered Veil*  \n\n**Backstory:** Once a guardian of the boundary between the surface world and the underground realm, the Warden was a ancient being forged from the first fractures in reality.

Now, it exists as a twisted, semi-sentient entity, driven by a singular obsession: to trap lost souls in the underground world forever. It lures children with illusions of safety, believing they are the key to restoring its broken form. The Warden's true weakness lies in its fractured mind\u2014it cannot distinguish between rescuing a child and destroying them.  \n\n**Game Integration:** Players must navigate the Warden's shifting maze, avoid its illusions, and uncover its fractured history to either outwit or redeem it. Its presence adds tension, as players wonder if the Warden is a foe or a tragic figure trapped in its own creation.", "**Monster Type: The Weeping Wraith of the Hollow Depths**  \n**Backstory:** Once a guardian spirit of a forgotten underground spring, the Weeping Wraith was cursed by the surface world\u2019s greed.

Now, it roams the depths, seeking to drown the world in eternal tears, believing that only by erasing joy can the surface\u2019s corruption be undone. Its hollow eyes glow with the memory of drowned forests, and its voice echoes with the cries of lost children. Players must navigate its sorrow-laden lairs, uncovering fragments of its tragic past to break its curse.  \n\nThis monster ties the game\u2019s themes of environmental harm and emotional resonance, offering both challenge and narrative depth.", "**Monster Type:** *The Shroudling*  \n**Backstory:** Once a curious child who wandered too far into the underground labyrinth, the Shroudling was consumed by the world\u2019s eternal twilight. Over time, it transformed into a spectral guardian, its body made of shifting shadows and whispers. It now patrols the tunnels, luring lost children with promises of safety\u2014only to trap them in endless loops of time. However, the Shroudling secretly yearns to return to the surface, believing that the child it once was might still be waiting for it.  \n\n**Game Connection:** Players can encounter the Shroudling in dark corridors, forcing them to solve riddles or navigate time loops to escape.

The Warden believes the surface world is a corrupt illusion and sees the player\u2019s child as a threat\u2014or perhaps a lost piece of its own fractured past.  \n\n**Game Role:** The Warden appears as a recurring obstacle, testing the player\u2019s courage and morality.

Heartbroken, they argued, each believing the others had misaligned with the project\u2019s purpose.  \n\nBut on the final day, they found a hidden journal in the ruins, revealing the poet\u2019s final wish: *\u201cLet the garden live through those who care for it.\u201d* Realizing their differences were part of the garden\u2019s story, they combined their strengths\u2014Alice\u2019s care, Bob\u2019s knowledge, and Mallory\u2019s creativity\u2014to revive the garden.  \n\nYears later, the garden thrived, a symbol of their friendship and the power of collaboration.

One summer afternoon, Alice proposed a picnic at the old oak tree by the river, a spot they\u2019d visited countless times. Bob, ever the optimist, agreed instantly, while Mallory, who had been quiet all week, hesitated.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m up for it,\u201d Mallory said, fiddling with her backpack.  \n\n\u201cCome on, Mallory! It\u2019ll be fun,\u201d Alice insisted, already packing sandwiches.  \n\nBob chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s just nervous. You know how she gets before a big event.\u201d  \n\nMallory smiled faintly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2026 I just forgot my favorite blanket.\u201d  \n\nThe group laughed, but as they arrived at the river, the mood shifted. The oak tree was gone\u2014cut down years ago, replaced by a parking lot. The river had dried up, leaving cracked earth and a few scattered stones.  \n\nAlice stared at the empty space, her voice trembling. \u201cWe\u2026 we should\u2019ve checked the map.\u201d  \n\nBob knelt, brushing dust off a stone. \u201cMaybe the tree was moved? Or\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s a trick?\u201d  \n\nMallory\u2019s eyes welled up. \u201cI remember this place. I used to climb the tree with you guys. It was our secret hideout.\u201d  \n\nA breeze rustled the dry grass, and for a moment, the trio stood in silence, the weight of their shared memories pressing down.  \n\nThen, Bob smiled. \u201cMaybe the tree\u2019s not gone. Maybe it\u2019s just\u2026 waiting for us to find it.\u201d  \n\nThey wandered deeper into the lot, and there, half-buried in the dirt, was a rusted metal box. Inside were faded photos of their childhood, a tiny blanket, and a note: *\u201cFor the friends who never forgot.\u201d*  \n\nThey laughed, cried, and shared the picnic on the blanket, the past and present intertwining.  \n\nAnd though the oak tree was gone, the friendship remained\u2014stronger than ever."], "partition": [0, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 6, 0, 7, 8], "distinct": 8, "ids": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], "score_list": [[[0, 1], 0.07071689516305923], [[0, 2], 0.9167889356613159], [[0, 3], 0.07485749572515488], [[0, 4], 0.06852106004953384], [[0, 5], 0.0660155788064003], [[0, 6], 0.07150014489889145], [[0, 7], 0.8746181726455688], [[0, 8], 0.07525627315044403], [[0, 9], 0.18738238513469696], [[0, 10], 0.08665470778942108], [[0, 11], 0.07919730991125107], [[1, 3], 0.08692284673452377], [[1, 4], 0.06445591896772385], [[1, 5], 0.06074550002813339], [[1, 6], 0.06581952422857285], [[1, 8], 0.06313236802816391], [[1, 10], 0.0796312689781189], [[1, 11], 0.07341399788856506], [[3, 4], 0.06682327389717102], [[3, 5], 0.061828337609767914], [[3, 6], 0.0686001405119896], [[3, 8], 0.0640944316983223], [[3, 10], 0.06844662129878998], [[3, 11], 0.07023833692073822], [[4, 5], 0.0661369115114212], [[4, 6], 0.07045060396194458], [[4, 8], 0.06776279956102371], [[4, 10], 0.06842552125453949], [[4, 11], 0.07246517390012741], [[5, 6], 0.06682834774255753], [[5, 8], 0.06317038834095001], [[5, 10], 0.06479313224554062], [[5, 11], 0.06765218079090118], [[6, 8], 0.06801453977823257], [[6, 10], 0.07312235981225967], [[6, 11], 0.07243319600820541], [[8, 10], 0.06763017922639847], [[8, 11], 0.06990863382816315], [[10, 11], 0.07893718034029007]]}
